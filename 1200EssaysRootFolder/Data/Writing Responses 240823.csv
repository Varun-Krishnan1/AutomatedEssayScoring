Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Is multitasking a good thing? While multitasking seems like a great way to get a lot done at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think they are. In fact, some research suggests that multitasking can actually hamper your productivity by reducing your comprehension, attention, and overall performance.1\n\nWhat is it that makes multitasking such a productivity killer? It might seem like you are accomplishing multiple things at the same time, but what you are really doing is quickly shifting your attention and focus from one thing to the next. Switching from one task to another may make it difficult to tune out distractions and can cause mental blocks that can slow you down.\n\nExamples of Multitasking\nStarting two projects at the same time\nListening to the radio while driving to work\nTalking on the phone while typing an assignment\nWatching television while responding to work emails\nScrolling through social media while in a meeting\nListening to a person talk while writing a to-do list\nHow Multitasking Hampers Productivity\nMultitasking takes a serious toll on productivity. Our brains lack the ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time—in moments where we think we're multitasking, we're likely just switching quickly from task to task.2 Focusing on a single task is a much more effective approach for several reasons.\n\nMultitasking Is Distracting\nMultitaskers may feel more distracted than people who focus on one task at a time. This makes sense when you consider that, by habit, multitaskers constantly refocus on a new task, effectively distracting themselves from their original assignment.\nSome research suggests that multitaskers are more distractible, and they may have trouble focusing their attention even when they're not working on multiple tasks at once.3\n\nOther research shows that while there may be a connection between multitasking and distraction, that link is smaller than originally thought and varies quite a bit from person to person.4\n\nMultitasking Slows You Down\nWhile it may seem contrary to popular belief, we tend to work slower and less efficiently when we multitask.2 Multitasking leads to what psychologists call \""task switch costs,\"" or the negative effects that come from switching from task to task. We encounter task switch costs (like a slower working pace) because of the increased mental demand that's associated with jumping from one thing to another.\n\nChanging our focus also keeps us from relying on automatic behaviors to finish tasks quickly. When we're focused on a single task that we've done before, we can work on \""autopilot,\"" which frees up mental resources. Switching back and forth bypasses this process, and we tend to work more slowly as a result.2\n\nMultitasking Impairs Executive Function\nMultitasking is managed by executive functions in the brain. These control and manage cognitive processes and determine how, when, and in what order certain tasks are performed. There are two stages to the executive control process:5\n\nGoal shifting: Deciding to do one thing instead of another\nRule activation: Changing from the rules for the previous task to the rules for the new task\nMoving through these stages may only add a few tenths of a second, but it can start to add up when people switch back and forth repeatedly. This might not be a big deal when you are folding laundry and watching television at the same time.\nHowever, if you are in a situation where safety or productivity is important, such as when you are driving in heavy traffic, even small amounts of time can prove critical.\n\nMultitaskers Make Mistakes\nMultitasking may lower your performance and make you more prone to making mistakes.2 Research has shown that students who multitask in class tend to have lower GPAs (and, if they continue multitasking at home, they often take longer to finish their homework).6\n\nAdults may also experience lower performance while multitasking. One 2018 study found that older adults were likely to make more mistakes while driving if they were multitasking.7\n\n 7 Tips for Becoming More Mentally Focused\nBrain Function in Multitaskers\nDoing several different things at once can impair cognitive ability, even for people who multitask frequently. In fact, research suggests that people tend to overestimate their ability to multitask, and the people who engage in this habit most frequently often lack the skills needed to be effective at it.8\n\n What Is Parallel Processing in Psychology?\nChronic multitaskers tend to show more impulsivity than their peers, and they may be more likely to downplay possible risks associated with tackling multiple things at once. They also seem to show lower levels of executive control and are often distracted easily.8\n\nLimited cognitive resources may be involved in this phenomenon.2 Several networks in the brain interact to guide our behavior whenever we set out to complete a task. This behavior includes:\n\nSetting a goal\nIdentifying the information we need to achieve it\nDisregarding irrelevant distractions\nWhen we try to engage in this process for multiple tasks at once, it can lead to cognitive errors. We might fail to disregard irrelevant information, for instance, which would lead to more distraction.\n\nThe research isn't clear on the exact relationship between multitasking and brain function. It's possible that chronic multitasking changes the brain over time, leading to more distractibility and problems with focus, or it may be that people with these traits are more likely to multitask in the first place.8\n\nTeens and Multitasking\nThe negative impact of chronic, heavy multitasking might be particularly detrimental to adolescent minds. At this age, brains are busy forming important neural connections. Spreading attention so thin and constantly being distracted by different streams of information might have a serious, long-term, negative impact on how these connections form.9\n\nMedia Multitasking\nSome research suggests that people who engage in media multitasking (using more than one form of media or type of technology at once) might be better at integrating visual and auditory information.\n\nIn one study, participants between the ages of 19 and 28 were asked to complete questionnaires regarding their media usage.10 The participants then completed a visual search task both with and without a sound to indicate when an item changed color.\n\nHeavy multitaskers performed better on the search when the sound was presented, indicating that they were more adept at integrating the two sources of sensory information. Conversely, heavy multitaskers performed worse than light/medium multitaskers when the tone was not present.\n\nBreak the Multitasking Habit\nIf you feel like multitasking is negatively impacting your life, it is possible to make some changes that will increase your productivity and efficiency. Next time you find yourself multitasking, take a quick assessment of the various things you are trying to accomplish. Then, determine which task you need to focus on first. Try to:\n\nLimit the number of things you juggle at any given time to just one task. If you do need to work on multiple things at once, try to combine something automatic, like folding laundry, with something that requires more focus, like having a conversation.\nUse the \""20-minute rule.\"" Instead of constantly switching between tasks, try to fully devote your attention to one task for 20 minutes before switching to the other.\nBatch your tasks. If you're having trouble resisting the urge to check your email or engage in another distracting task, schedule a set time in your day to tackle it. By batching similar tasks together and setting a time to handle them, you can free your mind up to focus on something else.\nLimit distractions. This may mean seeking out a quieter place to work, switching your phone off, and turning off notifications and alarms.\nPractice mindfulness. Adding mindfulness to your daily routine may help you notice the times when you're multitasking. Mindfulness can also improve your ability to focus and pay attention to one thing at a time.\nWorking on one task at a time may help you become more productive and it may make each task more enjoyable.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nIs multitasking bad for your health?\nYes, it can be. Multitasking may reduce your ability to focus, increase feelings of stress, and exacerbate impulsiveness. It can also worsen your performance at work or school, which can lead to further negative feelings and anxiety.2\n\nWhat does it mean if someone has trouble multitasking?\nIt means that, like most of us, their brain isn't wired to work on multiple complex tasks simultaneously. We perform much better when we focus fully on one thing at a time.\n\nShould I add multitasking as a skill on my resume?\nYou should consider whether or not you're really able to multitask before adding it to your resume. We have a tendency to overestimate our ability to multitask, and even people who think they're skilled in this area often make mistakes or work inefficiently.8\n\n How to Use Time Blocking to Manage Your Day\n10 Sources\n\nBy Kendra Cherry, MSEd\nKendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the \""Everything Psychology Book.\""\n\nSee Our Editorial Process\nMeet Our Review Board\nShare Feedback\n\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Gone are the days when older people were seemed to be ideal for leading an organization. But, now it has become an outmoded fashion as young leadership has proved their worth. Some people, therefore, believe that organizations should pave the way for young leadership. To my way of thinking, leadership has no business with age. So, if a young man deserve the leadership, he should be rewarded it.\n\nFor a start, leadership knows no age as it is an inborn trait. Leaders are the individuals who have innate ability to encourage others to realize their real potential, make people confident, and invoke the sense of responsibility. Most importantly, leaders possess the attitude that they want to be in the front of others. They tend to confront challenges and are ready to face any bitter experience. Another key thing to remember is that the leaders have the intrinsic acumen that they can think promptly and can make good judgment without experience or beyond their age. Thus, age does not matter for preferring leadership.\n\nIn addition, the era we live in is the epoch of technology. Modern technology prevails in each and every workplace around the world. In this technology-driven workplace, young leadership can streamline an organization comparing to their counterpart. This is because, youngsters are usually tech-savvy, and they are more comfort with the technology than the older generation. So, young people, in this era of technology, are only able to contemplate a clear vision of how an organization will develop in the coming future.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Older people are often regarded as better leaders due to their accumulated wisdom, experience, and steady demeanor. Their years of life and learning contribute to a well-rounded perspective that can guide organizations, communities, and societies effectively. In leadership roles, their qualities and insights can bring about stability, better decision-making, and a sense of direction.\nFirstly, experience plays a pivotal role in shaping a leader's abilities. Older individuals have had the opportunity to face a wide array of challenges, failures, and successes. This exposure enables them to make informed decisions and navigate complexities with a sense of calmness. They are more likely to anticipate potential pitfalls, draw from past encounters, and develop strategies that have stood the test of time.\n\nSecondly, older leaders tend to possess strong interpersonal skills, honed through years of interacting with diverse groups. Their capacity to empathize, understand differing viewpoints and communicate effectively fosters an inclusive environment. This ability to connect with others is instrumental in resolving conflicts, nurturing teamwork, and motivating individuals toward common goals.\n\nFurthermore, their long-term perspective aligns with sustainable leadership. Older leaders often prioritize strategies that benefit not just the present, but also future generations. Their focus on legacy drives them to make choices that endure and have positive repercussions over extended periods, fostering stability and continuity.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that effective leadership is not solely defined by age. Younger leaders can bring innovation, fresh perspectives, and adaptability to the table. Nonetheless, the value of older leaders lies in the depth of their experiences, the richness of their insights, and the steadiness of their approach.\nIn conclusion, older people's superior leadership capabilities stem from their extensive life experiences, enhanced interpersonal skills, and long-term perspective. Their wisdom, garnered over time, makes them adept at steering through challenges and making well-informed decisions. While age is not the sole determinant of leadership prowess, the qualities associated with older leaders undoubtedly contribute to their effectiveness in guiding individuals, organizations, and societies toward success and sustainability.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""It has been argued that older people tend to be better leaders. One of the reasons proposed for their enhanced leadership ability is experience, both in their professional and personal lives. This is believed to have equipped them with the resiliience and fortitude to not just deal with the different problems which life throws at them but also to help others navigate the vicissitudes of life. However, as this essay argues, the co-assocation between increasing age and enhanced leadership can also be a flawed one.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the older an individual is, the more likely it is that he/ she has been exposed to a range of positive and negative experiences, both in their personal and professional lives. Assuming that these have served as valuable learning opportunities, one can reach the conclusion that older people tend to be better leaders since they are in the privileged position of drawing from a wider range of experience than their younger counterparts. Experience brings with it not just wisdom but also a sense of confidence in one's ability to weather difficult times. This would also potentially explain the enhanced leadership ability of older individuals.\n\nHowever, it should also be borne in mind that in many cases, age might just be a number. A highly motivated and capable individual who has been able to climb the career ladder faster, might be able to amass more experience in a shorter span of time. Arguably, in his/her case, it is aptitude rather than age which has a more decisive role to play. Self-confidence is also not age-dependent. Therefore, it could also be argued that it is the right set of skills rather than chronological age which  determines an individual's leadership ability.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Secondly, it is a matter of fact that the youngsters are energetic, talented and judgmental. They not only make quick decisions but also end up investing in some unrelated stuffs without thinking. This is not the case with elders. They think numerous times before they make any decisions. For instance, my grandfather takes at least one day to decide anything related to the family. This behavior not only aids him to make the best decisions but also teaches his kids about the importance of patience. Hence, it is proved that elders make better decisions and help in the success of the company.\n\nFinally, it is widely accepted that youth today are easily attracted towards the outside worldly life. If this is their mindset, then it is not beneficial for the progress of the company. For example, a negative comment on Facebook or Instagram may enrage a young proprietor and their thoughtless response could lead to many problems for the company.\n\nThis kind of attitude not only ruins the person but also their business. Therefore, seniors who have sound knowledge on everything should be on top position to guide others and this will lead to the success of the organization.

Firstly, the young generation will lose the influence to join sections where mostly old people are preferred. And sometimes because of the age gap, aged leaders failed to fulfill the need or opportunities of the current generation.

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Title: Evaluating the Leadership Abilities of Older Individuals\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe notion that older people make better leaders has been a subject of debate for years. While some argue that accumulated experience and wisdom with age make older individuals more adept at leading, others contend that effective leadership qualities can be found across all age groups. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument to ascertain whether older people indeed make much better leaders.\n\nArguments in Favor of Older People as Better Leaders:\n\nOne of the main reasons supporting the idea that older people are better leaders lies in their wealth of experience. Years spent in various roles allow them to gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and mentor others effectively. Moreover, their exposure to diverse situations enables them to navigate through challenges with poise and resilience, traits that are invaluable in a leader.\n\nAdditionally, older individuals often have a better understanding of human behavior and are more empathetic, promoting a harmonious work environment. Their ability to communicate effectively and mediate conflicts fosters stronger teamwork and camaraderie among team members. These qualities, combined with their seasoned leadership style, can lead to long-term success and stability within organizations.\n\nArguments in Favor of Leadership Abilities Across All Age Groups:\n\nWhile experience is undeniably valuable, it is not solely determined by age. Younger individuals can possess exceptional leadership qualities, such as adaptability, innovation, and risk-taking, which are essential in dynamic and fast-paced environments. In the era of technological advancements, younger leaders may be more attuned to digital trends and capable of embracing change, making them highly valuable assets in the modern workforce.\n\nFurthermore, diversity in leadership can bring a broader range of perspectives to the table, leading to more inclusive decision-making processes. Embracing leaders from different age groups and backgrounds can result in enhanced creativity and innovation, contributing to a more progressive and adaptable organization.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, whether older people make much better leaders is a nuanced debate. While experience and wisdom gained with age are undoubtedly advantageous, it is essential to recognize that effective leadership qualities can be found across all age groups. Combining the strengths of experienced leaders with the fresh perspectives and innovation of younger ones can lead to a dynamic and thriving leadership team. As society evolves, we should aim to create a diverse leadership landscape that appreciates and utilizes the talents of individuals from all walks of life. By doing so, we can foster a rich and vibrant leadership culture that promotes growth and success for all.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""\nLeadership is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a crucial role in various aspects of society, including business, politics, and community organizations. One common notion that has been debated over time is whether older individuals are inherently better leaders. While some argue that age brings experience, wisdom, and a steady demeanor, others believe that effective leadership is not solely determined by age. This essay aims to delve into the factors that contribute to leadership effectiveness and whether age plays a definitive role in this context\n\n   One of the arguments in favor of older people being better leaders is their accumulated experience and wisdom. Years of exposure to different situations can provide insights into problem-solving, decision-making, and conflict resolution. This experience can lead to a more balanced and informed leadership approach, which is often vital in navigating complex challenges.\n\n   Emotional intelligence, which encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, is a crucial trait for successful leadership. Older individuals may have had more opportunities to develop their emotional intelligence, which can enhance their ability to understand and connect with their team members, fostering a positive work environment.\n\n   Effective leadership requires the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and evolving trends. While some argue that older individuals might be less adaptable, it's important to note that adaptability is not solely tied to age. Leaders of all ages can demonstrate a willingness to learn, innovate, and adjust their strategies based on new information.\n\n   A diverse leadership team often brings a wide range of perspectives, leading to better decision-making and creative problem-solving. Age diversity within leadership ensures a mix of viewpoints, resulting in a more holistic approach to tackling challenges.\n\n   Leadership skills can be developed at any stage of life. While experience is valuable, it's essential for leaders of all ages to engage in ongoing learning and skill development to stay relevant and effective in their roles.\n\n   The effectiveness of a leader can depend greatly on the context in which they are operating. Different situations may require different leadership styles and approaches. Therefore, it's important not to generalize that older individuals are universally better leaders.\n\n     In conclusion, the idea that older people are inherently better leaders is not a definitive assertion. While age can bring experience, wisdom, and emotional intelligence, effective leadership is a combination of various factors. Leaders of all ages can possess the necessary skills and attributes to succeed, and it's crucial to recognize the importance of diverse perspectives and continuous learning in leadership roles. Ultimately, the success of a leader depends on their ability to adapt, connect with their team, and make informed decisions, regardless of their age.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Experience is the best teacher. It is the main reason why I strongly believe that most successful leaders are the older people who have many experience in their life. However, there are many people who argue that young leaders are better because of their vision towards the future.\n\nThe skills of leadership are totally depends on how many times an individual have overcame the issues in their teams successfully. Old leaders' ability to tackle problems in the middle of their project have proven because only a good leader will survives on their position until they are old. Moreover, older people have more experience supervising many different type of their employees' personalities, so that they will more able to prevent and handle social conficts within the team. The old age also brings its own advantage because they will get more respect from younger employee due to moral reasons.\n\nFrom another point of view, the opposites argue that young people are very potential to be a better leader. They state that younger people can see the future more precisely because most of them have grown in the modern era. They also master cutting-edge technology so that they can produce their work more easily, quickly and high quality. In all, it is also some reasons that make young people become considerably good leader. However, the leaders' job is making a reasonable decision by considering many aspect. This young group mostly lack of this experience, because they have not faced enough difficult situation in team work, especially regarding to their team's attitude.\n\nTo sum up, it is evident that older age group have more experiences in leadership so that they are a better leader than the youngsters. It is because the young is lack of experience in making decision, contrasting with their older counterparts. In my opinion, because young people can utilize advance technology well and have a better ability to seeing of the future, they will better be supervised by experienced older people""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Personally, I completely disagree with this statement because those aged staffs with experiences can bring more advantages for a group.\n\nIt is obvious that experienced people have expert power - which can hardly be found in a young leader, to give right directions to their subordinates in work. As a result, an efficient working routine with controllable outcomes will be set up, making a better reputation for company. Furthermore, when an unexpected problem happens, an aged senior staff will be more quickly to find a feasible solution than the younger one since their problem-solving skill has been developed through years. For example, when facing an on-site issue in construction industry, a 20 years experience architect can sit at the office and tell the workers exactly what they can do. Meanwhile, it will take a lot of time for a 5 years leader to find the same solution.

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""It is true that higher positions are usually held by older members in many organizations these days. While some people believe younger people would demonstrate better leadership, it is in my opinion that senior managers possess more advantages over their younger counterparts in leading a company. To begin with, it is usually difficult for the young to compete with the old in terms of experience. those who have gained adequate experience can more effectively manage to lead the individuals of an organization than those who do not. The reason for this is that business matters often require the people in charge to have not only the knowledge of coping with problematic situations but also strong nerves to calmly find a feasible solution. As a result, years of experience in a relevant position tend to make the elderly better candidates than those who are relatively young and new to the tasks. Another advantage belonging to aged people is that they are likely to receive more support from the people in an organization. As the time spent working with the staff of the senior is often longer, they can understand their colleagues better, achieving more popularity. It is interpersonal communication skills and approval of other people that can tremendously affect the success of a leader. Younger members, on the other hand, will need more time to make contributions over time to prove themselves worthy.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that critical positions of authority should be given to senior staff members for the certain reasons mentioned rather than the young.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

These experiences offer a broader understanding of various situations, allowing them to approach challenges with a more informed and balanced outlook. This reservoir of knowledge helps older leaders make wiser decisions, drawing upon past successes and failures to shape their strategies.\n\nSecondly, older individuals often possess refined emotional intelligence, which plays a vital role in effective leadership. Emotional intelligence enables leaders to understand and empathize with their team members, fostering a harmonious and productive work environment. This skill allows older leaders to connect with their subordinates on a deeper level, gaining their trust and loyalty.\n\nMoreover, older leaders are typically better at handling complex and high-pressure situations. Having weathered numerous storms in their personal and professional lives, they have developed resilience and composure, enabling them to navigate challenging circumstances with grace.

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""The managers and the chairmen of most of the institutions and organizations are older adults. It is generally argued that youngsters could manage these positions better than older people. However, I do not agree with this argument because of three different reasons.\n\nFirstly, it is obvious that youths are less experienced and have least exposure to the world and the organization. With hardly any experience they will not be able to lead the organization to reach its vision and this could probably result in the closure of the company. For example, when young and inexperienced people start a company, they may taste some success initially. But as the business grows, their lack of experience may lead to problems and the company could shut down.  Therefore, it is evident that older people can do better than younger ones.\n\nSecondly, it is a matter of fact that the youngsters are energetic, talented and judgmental. They not only make quick decisions but also end up investing in some unrelated stuffs without thinking. This is not the case with elders. They think numerous times before they make any decisions. For instance, my grandfather takes at least one day to decide anything related to the family. This behavior not only aids him to make the best decisions but also teaches his kids about the importance of patience. Hence, it is proved that elders make better decisions and help in the success of the company.\n\nFinally, it is widely accepted that youth today are easily attracted towards the outside worldly life. If this is their mindset, then it is not beneficial for the progress of the company. For example, a negative comment on Facebook or Instagram may enrage a young proprietor and their thoughtless response could lead to many problems for the company.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Leadership is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a crucial role in various aspects of society, including business, politics, and community organizations. One common notion that has been debated over time is whether older individuals are inherently better leaders. While some argue that age brings experience, wisdom, and a steady demeanor, others believe that effective leadership is not solely determined by age. This essay aims to delve into the factors that contribute to leadership effectiveness and whether age plays a definitive role in this context.\n               One of the arguments in favor of older  people being better leaders is their accumulated experience and wisdom. Years of exposure to different situations can provide insights into problem-solving, decision-making, and conflict resolution. This experience can lead to a more balanced and informed leadership approach, which is often vital in navigating complex challenges \n                              Emotional intelligence, which encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, is a crucial trait for successful leadership. Older individuals may have had more opportunities to develop their emotional intelligence, which can enhance their ability to understand and connect with their team members, fostering a positive work environment.\n         Effective leadership requires the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and evolving trends. While some argue that older individuals might be less adaptable, it's important to note that adaptability is not solely tied to age. Leaders of all ages can demonstrate a willingness to learn, innovate, and adjust their strategies based on new information.\n           A diverse leadership team often brings a wide range of perspectives, leading to better decision-making and creative problem-solving. Age diversity within leadership ensures a mix of viewpoints, resulting in a more holistic approach to tackling challenges.\n       Leadership skills can be developed at any stage of life. While experience is valuable, it's essential for leaders of all ages to engage in ongoing learning and skill development to stay relevant and effective in their roles.\n   The effectiveness of a leader can depend greatly on the context in which they are operating. Different situations may require different leadership styles and approaches. Therefore, it's important not to generalize that older individuals are universally better leaders\n      In conclusion, the idea that older people are inherently better leaders is not a definitive assertion. While age can bring experience, wisdom, and emotional intelligence, effective leadership is a combination of various factors. Leaders of all ages can possess the necessary skills and attributes to succeed, and it's crucial to recognize the importance of diverse perspectives and continuous learning in leadership roles. Ultimately, the success of a leader depends on their ability to adapt, connect with their team, and make informed decisions, regardless of their age.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Their years of navigating various situations provide them with a wealth of knowledge and insights that can guide decision-making and problem-solving. Moreover, older individuals tend to possess a heightened sense of patience and resilience, attributes crucial for effective leadership.\n\nMature leaders typically have a well-developed ability to mentor and guide younger team members, fostering a positive learning environment. Their steady temperament and composed demeanor under pressure can inspire confidence and stability within an organization. Older leaders also tend to have well-established networks and connections, which can facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing, benefiting both the organization and its employees.\n\n**Disagree:**\n\nWhile older people may possess valuable life experiences, it's important to recognize that effective leadership is not solely determined by age. Leadership skills are multifaceted and can be honed by individuals of all ages through education, training, and practical experience. Younger leaders bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and adaptability to a rapidly changing world.\n\nAdditionally, the ability to lead effectively often requires staying current with evolving technologies and trends. Younger leaders may have a natural affinity for embracing new tools and methods, which can be vital in today's fast-paced business landscape. In some cases, older leaders might be resistant to change or overly reliant on traditional approaches, potentially hindering growth and innovation within an organization.\n\nUltimately, effective leadership is a combination of various qualities, including communication, empathy, strategic thinking, and the ability to inspire and motivate others.

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""The managers and the chairmen of most of the institutions and organizations are older adults. It is generally argued that youngsters could manage these positions better than older people. However, I do not agree with this argument because of three different reasons.\n\nFirstly, it is obvious that youths are less experienced and have least exposure to the world and the organization. With hardly any experience they will not be able to lead the organization to reach its vision and this could probably result in the closure of the company. For example, when young and inexperienced people start a company, they may taste some success initially. But as the business grows, their lack of experience may lead to problems and the company could shut down.  Therefore, it is evident that older people can do better than younger ones.\n\nSecondly, it is a matter of fact that the youngsters are energetic, talented and judgmental. They not only make quick decisions but also end up investing in some unrelated stuffs without thinking. This is not the case with elders. They think numerous times before they make any decisions. For instance, my grandfather takes at least one day to decide anything related to the family. This behavior not only aids him to make the best decisions but also teaches his kids about the importance of patience. Hence, it is proved that elders make better decisions and help in the success of the company.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Older people are said to be much better leaders.","""Is multitasking a good thing? While multitasking seems like a great way to get a lot done at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think they are. In fact, some research suggests that multitasking can actually hamper your productivity by reducing your comprehension, attention, and overall performance.1\nJeong S-H, Hwang Y. Media multitasking effects on cognitive vs. attitudinal outcomes: A meta-analysis. Hum Commun Res. 2016;42(4):599-618. doi:10.1111/hcre.12089\n\n\nWhat is it that makes multitasking such a productivity killer? It might seem like you are accomplishing multiple things at the same time, but what you are really doing is quickly shifting your attention and focus from one thing to the next. Switching from one task to another may make it difficult to tune out distractions and can cause mental blocks that can slow you down.\n\nExamples of Multitasking\nStarting two projects at the same time\nListening to the radio while driving to work\nTalking on the phone while typing an assignment\nWatching television while responding to work emails\nScrolling through social media while in a meeting\nListening to a person talk while writing a to-do list\nHow Multitasking Hampers Productivity\nMultitasking takes a serious toll on productivity. Our brains lack the ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time—in moments where we think we're multitasking, we're likely just switching quickly from task to task.2 Focusing on a single task is a much more effective approach for several reasons.\n\nMultitasking Is Distracting\nMultitaskers may feel more distracted than people who focus on one task at a time. This makes sense when you consider that, by habit, multitaskers constantly refocus on a new task, effectively distracting themselves from their original assignment.\nSome research suggests that multitaskers are more distractible, and they may have trouble focusing their attention even when they're not working on multiple tasks at once.3\n\nOther research shows that while there may be a connection between multitasking and distraction, that link is smaller than originally thought and varies quite a bit from person to person.4\n\nMultitasking Slows You Down\nWhile it may seem contrary to popular belief, we tend to work slower and less efficiently when we multitask.2 Multitasking leads to what psychologists call \""task switch costs,\"" or the negative effects that come from switching from task to task. We encounter task switch costs (like a slower working pace) because of the increased mental demand that's associated with jumping from one thing to another.\n\nChanging our focus also keeps us from relying on automatic behaviors to finish tasks quickly. When we're focused on a single task that we've done before, we can work on \""autopilot,\"" which frees up mental resources. Switching back and forth bypasses this process, and we tend to work more slowly as a result.2\n\nMultitasking Impairs Executive Function\nMultitasking is managed by executive functions in the brain. These control and manage cognitive processes and determine how, when, and in what order certain tasks are performed. There are two stages to the executive control process:5\n\nGoal shifting: Deciding to do one thing instead of another\nRule activation: Changing from the rules for the previous task to the rules for the new task\nMoving through these stages may only add a few tenths of a second, but it can start to add up when people switch back and forth repeatedly. This might not be a big deal when you are folding laundry and watching television at the same time.\nHowever, if you are in a situation where safety or productivity is important, such as when you are driving in heavy traffic, even small amounts of time can prove critical.\n\nMultitaskers Make Mistakes\nMultitasking may lower your performance and make you more prone to making mistakes.2 Research has shown that students who multitask in class tend to have lower GP""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

As we human beings only have one Earth, it is important to care about the planet we are living. Nevertheless, developing and making progress in technology, economy are also important for countries if they want the citizens to have a better life, while I suggest that when a country becomes richer, the natural environment will suffer.\nFirst of all, when a country wants to boost their economy, the country must develop their business all over the world and collaborate with other countries, which means they need to put a great amount of money in developing transportation. However, transportation costs a lot of gasoline and natural resources, leading to a negative impact on the environment. \nMoreover, harming the environment is almost inevitable when a country is developing since industry must be an important factor in enhancing economy. Taking China as an example, we can notice that the capital of China, Beijing, was having a really bad air condition in the past few years because of the increasing amount of industry and buildings. \nOn the other hand, if a country is already rich enough, they can stop those action which harming the environment. Instead, they can start to promote the idea of creating environment friendly products, decreasing carbon footprints in the city. But for those countries which still trying to be developed, they need to pay the cost and no one can do it without losing anything. Hence, it is impossible for a country to develop its economy while protecting the environment at the same time.

Firstly, looking back at the history, the  developed countries had polluted the earth environment severely. They are urging the world to protect our surrounding for two reasons. One reason is that with the help of high-end technology, they can achieve the economic goals while also limiting the comsuption of energy or resources. The other reason is to suppress developing countries' speed of economic expansion. The history book hasn't recorded any developed country that rose themselves up without harming the environment. \n\nMore importantly, I reckon that it all comes down to the fact that our resources are limited.

I think that the idea that suggest an economic growth with the cost of damaged natural environment comes from the conventional view of profitable industries of mass energy consumption and heavy pollution. This used to be a common practice at the era of the Industrial Revolution, during which there are limited forms of industry and little attention to a natural and untouched environment. People are too greedy and short-sighted to notice the price of such development at the time. When the development of a coutry is based on such industries, the previous idea may make sense to some extent. However, this is not always the case as there are other ways of development that are enviromentally-friendly. For example, high-technology industries that products precision instruments gain far more profits while requiring little materials compared to basic ones such as steel industries. When a country has the right to choose among its development methods, it will definitely boost the ecomomic fields of better environmental outputs. Only if a country is poor in its industral and technological basis and has no solution to that will it sacrefice the natural environment for economic growth. This does exists in certain countries at specific historical periods, but many countries have proved it wrong by their construction achievements. Among them are Sigapore which makes full use of its position as an international harbour, Israel which relies on its military industries, etc..

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""Introduction:\nIn today's fast-paced world, the pursuit of wealth often takes center stage, overshadowing the importance of cultivating a high quality of life. While financial stability is undeniably crucial, placing an excessive emphasis on earning money can lead to a host of negative consequences. This essay delves into the reasons behind the prevailing focus on money, examines its impact on the pursuit of a good quality of life, and suggests ways to strike a healthier balance.\n\nThe Pressure to Earn:\nIn a society where success is frequently measured by material possessions, the pressure to earn money becomes all-consuming. Advertisements, social media, and societal norms often perpetuate the idea that a lavish lifestyle equates to happiness and achievement. This leads individuals to prioritize financial gains over more intangible but equally important aspects of life, such as personal relationships, mental well-being, and leisure activities.\n\nDetrimental Effects on Well-Being:\nAs the focus on earning money intensifies, individuals may find themselves sacrificing their physical and mental well-being. Long working hours, stress, and neglect of self-care can result in burnout and deteriorating health. The relentless pursuit of wealth can strain relationships, cause isolation, and lead to a diminished sense of satisfaction with life. Paradoxically, the very pursuit of financial success that was meant to improve quality of life may end up eroding it.\n\nNeglecting Life's True Joys:\nPlacing too much emphasis on earning money can detract from life's true joys. Meaningful experiences, leisure time, and spending moments with loved ones often take a backseat to career pursuits. The pursuit of a good quality of life entails appreciating simple pleasures, cultivating hobbies, and nurturing social connections, all of which can be overshadowed by the relentless chase for money.\n\nStriking a Balance:\nIt is important to recognize that financial stability is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. Striking a balance between earning money and seeking a good quality of life is crucial for holistic well-being. This involves reassessing priorities, setting boundaries on work hours, and allocating time for leisure and personal growth. Encouraging a shift in societal values towards embracing work-life balance, mental health, and interpersonal relationships can also help reorient perspectives.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, while financial stability remains an essential aspect of modern life, it is imperative to resist the lure of placing excessive emphasis on earning money. A good quality of life encompasses physical and mental well-being, meaningful experiences, and strong relationships. By reevaluating our priorities and pursuing a more balanced approach, we can move beyond the narrow pursuit of wealth and towards a richer, more fulfilling existence. After all, true prosperity lies not just in accumulating wealth, but in living a life that is rich in contentment and happiness.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""In the words of Warren Buffet 'if you don't make money while you sleep, you will work until you die'. We live in a society where we are brought up to leave school or university and get a high paying job. This leads people to focus very heavily on finding the best paying jobs in their industry and work hard to keep that pay cheque coming in every month, then work even harder to gain a small pay rise or promotion. This is a traditional way of that had been perceived as becoming successful in life. However, this philosophy has some fundamental problems with it.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""As we all know that we are living in a modern world of technologies. In many field technologies has reduced or made it easy for the work of humans. For example in the office, railway station, airports, hospitals,....etc. It is good to see that human work has become easier but at the same time there is a challenge for the people to build up themselves to be able to perform multi task so that they can earn their bread & butter. I agree that today's people are very busy  in earning money and they emphasis  on it because they have their family to feed, support the future of their children through education, maintain the standard of living & maintain health. But in this process the bread earner of the family has to sacrifice their interests & pleasure to live a good quality of life. They neglect themselves to fulfill the desires of their family members. At times they forget about themselves as they are too much engrossed in their daily work. Such people hardly able to give a quality time to their family members, their health & their pleasure. Instead they have made themselves a machine to earn money than to earn happiness. \n\nIn spite of busy schedule there are people whom I have observed that along with the earning of bread & butter people are understanding the need of giving priorities to their family. People are becoming smarter to balance between professional & personal life.  Now a days there are people who understand the value of good quality life. They indulge themselves in work as well as sports or gym. Because they understand the value of health & spending time with their family members. I do understand that financially independent is important but at the same time living a good quality life is very important. Along with earning money one needs to emphasis in spending quality time with family, friends, with their interests like sports, outing, travelling, hobbies & other fun activities which makes us happy from within. This is important to rejuvenate ourselves & energies ourselves with positive energy to work with more enthusiastic & lively way.

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""One of the famous quotes which is often used to illustrate why we should not be attached to money is that of Alexander the Great, who is reported to have said \""when you bury my body, don't build any momentum and keep my hands outside so that the world knows that the person who won the whole world had nothing in his hand while dying.\"" Admittedly, there is much more to human life than money and pleasure. However, can we really enjoy a good quality of life without money. Try asking that to the father who cannot afford to provide his children with a proper meal at night or the Malagasy who despite striving hard to earn a living does not have access to running water. For the latter money is can buy happiness since his or her happiness lies in meeting basic needs and having water to drink and batch, adequate food to eat would be qualified as being gold standard quality of life. However, it is very unlikely that the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos would have the same conceptualization of quality of life. Quality of life is defined differently for those who have enough money to fulfill their basic needs. For example, as per the Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, quality of relationships might be of greater importance. For others it might be achievement at the workplace. Ultimately, one should move beyond all the ego needs to focus on growth. It is true that in today’s worlds much emphasis is placed on money and we forget that money is only a means to an end, never the end itself.

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""ecent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

This leads people to focus very heavily on finding the best paying jobs in their industry and work hard to keep that pay cheque coming in every month, then work even harder to gain a small pay rise or promotion. This is a traditional way of was is perceived as becoming successful in life. However, this philosophy has some fundamental problems with it. \n\nFirslty when you are working for a pay cheque you are purely swapping your time for money. This could be in the form of an hourly wage so for each hour you work you get paid for that work. Clearly if you don’t work then you don’t get paid. If you are on a salary, it is a similar situation. Yes, you might get holiday pay but perhaps only 25 days, which if a year if not a lot of time to enjoy the things you really love. Typically, with salaried jobs, people tend to work a lot more hours to get the tasks they have been assigned completed and if they go off sick then they might not get paid or if for some reason they have to stop working then they have no income coming it. This can cause real problems for the future for example losing your job or not being able to work for some reason, especially as the average family in the UK has only two months of savings in their bank. Obviously then after two months with no income coming in, they will find themselves in some real problems as they have mortgages to pay, utilities bill, and food to buy, let alone spare money for living on. \n\nHowever, how would it be if you could go away for months on end, not working and still have regular income pouring in, whatever you were doing? What about if you want to cut down your hours to spend more time with family or more time off traveling? This ability would allow a lot of freedom in life and it wouldn’t matter if you were ill or didn’t work for a while a you have the security of knowing that your basic costs of living would be covered, and you could survive for a year without a job. This is what people would love to be able to do but don’t think it is possible. Well it is very feasible if you know how to invest money, making it work harder than in a bank and then receive passive regular recurring income from those investments. \n\nMost people are working far too hard focusing on gaining higher paying jobs and working harder and harder to gain that pay cheque coming in every month. Instead what about if they focused on creating reoccurring passive income from investments that make money while they sleep that is dependent on working to receive that money. If people spent more time focusing on investing and growing their money over time so that eventually they can receive monthly passive income then they would have a lot more security in their life and have the freedom to go and do the things they actually want to do in life, not having to worry about working to get money coming in. It seems a very unfair trade off to work for five days a week to get only two off in return or even worse spending the majority of the year working to get a few weeks off. \n\nAn example of this would be if someone was to invest in an HMO property, they could receive between £500 and £1000 + EVERY MONTH for the term they own that property for. How many of those would it take to replace someone’s salary? I would guess between two to four. That’s it! Yes, they would have some work to do upfront with purchasing the property and getting to ready to be let (unless you find a partner to do all of that for you thus creating a truly passive investment),and then hand it over to a letting agent who would deal with the ongoing management and letting of the property so they do not have to get involved at all. \n\nHow would you feel if you knew you had a that sort of money coming in each month without having to do anything from it? You are literally getting paid while you sleep! There are also other benefits from owning property such as the capital growth in the future from the property which they could eventually benefit from if they wished. \n\nThis would allow you to retire early if you wanted to or cut down your hours at work or go and get the job someone actually wants and not just one for a higher salary. Perhaps go part time and spend more time doing other more enjoyable pursuits, knowing that whatever happens they will be able to pay the bills and not have to worry about money if there is no traditional income coming in from a job. \n\nIf people were to spend more time focusing on investing and growing their spare cash, opposed to working harder and harder to make more then people would be a lot happier. \n\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

An object can make a person happy for a short while but happiness is for a lifetime. If somebody thinks money can buy happiness then that is not true happiness.\n\nMoney is given huge importance and the simple things which bring us true happiness are often overlooked. One of the things that give happiness is love. It does not cost anything but can fill your life with happiness. This feeling cannot be purchased. It cannot be traded for any amount of money in the world. Generally, people believe that they can make someone feel happy or loved with the help of money, and perhaps they can but only for a while.Happiness is a difficult word to define. The way of measuring happiness is different for everyone. Few people trust that money can buy happiness, whereas others disagree. According to me, although having lots of money will surely provide us lot of ways to entertain ourselves but it can’t buy love and happiness.\n\nMoney can’t buy love and a happy life comes from having good friends and family who care about us. Our life becomes meaningful and happy when we are around loved ones. For example, I have read an article about a famous actress in Bollywood who died due to depression and was all alone during her last days. She had been a really popular actress because of her beauty and acting skills. Even though she was earning a huge fortune every year, she was not happy as she didn’t have any close friend or family who could take care of her. Whereas I have seen people who have a happy life without money because they are surrounded by people who love them and care for them.\n\nIn most cases people have to work hard to earn lots of money and due to which they have less time for their social life. Many businessmen work 6 days a week and earn good money but they don’t have the time to spend that money and remain stressed. People have money but if they don’t have the time to enjoy their life than it is worthless.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

That's why time is money, so the more time we have, the more money we can obtain. Let's look at it in another way. Is time the more valuable here, or we are wasting it to accumulate something less valuable?\nYou can't get the lost moments back\nThere are numerous ways to earn more money. As it's not something we want to do, we still have the option to sell possessions, work an extra hour, offering a freelance work, or maybe even win a few bucks on a lottery ticket. But there is no way to create more time. You can't add an extra hour to the day, can't give yourself 10 extra years by investing in the \""market.\"" Time is limited for us. We may have 85 years to live and proceed, or we may only get 30. This is worth keeping in mind when you are investing more time making money than you are with friends and family. Those times are valuable and long-lasting.\nYou can do more with a Day off than with a Day's Pay\nA paid day is different for everyone, Paid day to a CEO person or an employee is still the same, owing to the situation. Either it can buy you a new IPad or a new Suit, the point is that a day's pay is finite. You will use a limited amount of money that can buy a limited luxury.\nWith a day off work, the world is your oyster. Well, you may be not traveling to Paris or Hiking Mount Everest, but you really can do all sorts of stuff that you can't do while at work. You can spend that time to paint that picture were dreaming for or you can try a new recipe. You can meditate, and find some of that inner peace you've been looking for. At the end of the day, a \""thing\"" that costs money will never compete with an experience that broadens the mind or simply makes you happy.\nTime Creates More Memories than Money\nWhat about all those best moments in your life so far? Few of them are based on money, Most of them based on time spent with friends and family!! Very rarely we sit back and thought, yes! The day I got that new dress was awesome! Our most treasured memories come from time spent with the people we love, and in places we explored. Yes, it certainly cost you a few bucks to travel.

Some people are of opinion that earning money is important whereas other think that living a quality lie is important. I am partially agree with the statement that money and quality of life both are important.\n        To begin with,  some people  spend their life in earning more and more money .\nQuality of life is a highly subjective measure of happiness that is an essential component of many financial decisions. Factors that play a role in the quality of life vary according to personal preferences, but they often include financial security, job satisfaction, family life, health, and safety. Some of the people have a belief that money can bring anything including happiness. They have dreams to buy luxury goods such as big houses, limited edition cars, updated gadgets or even to collect prestige belongings like rare paintings, sculptures, and something like that, and through that they will feel happy because their stratification in society increasing. In my point of view because enjoyment might not be bought by a piece of papers called dollars. Psychologists explained that if we think money can afford anything, it will be a well-known agreement that the rich are the society class gaining the happiest life, but in the fact, in some ways, tells dissimilar. The rich have more risks to get problems in their families, in educating their children, and other relating impacts which all of them are similarly inevitable. This mindset, the way of thinking that money cannot afford happiness, can be a locomotive for the believers for finding a job which is convenient to avoid the dire effects. \nOn the one hand, it is true that in a way, money leads to a better life quality. With more money we can, for instance, consume more, buy good quality products, go on holidays and do numerous activities. All these things contribute to a more enjoyable life. Even though the job we do does not completely satisfy us, all the other moments apart from our job time will be filled with exciting things.

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""In today's fast-paced world, the pursuit of wealth often takes center stage, overshadowing the equally important pursuit of a good quality of life. While financial stability is undeniably crucial for meeting basic needs and achieving certain aspirations, an excessive emphasis on earning money can lead to detrimental effects on one's overall well-being.\n\nIn the modern era, success is often equated with monetary achievements. Individuals are encouraged to climb the corporate ladder, accumulate material possessions, and engage in relentless competition. In this race for affluence, personal relationships, leisure time, and mental health can all be compromised. The pressure to earn more can result in longer working hours, increased stress levels, and a reduced ability to engage in activities that bring joy and fulfillment.\n\nConversely, a good quality of life encompasses a holistic approach that considers physical, emotional, and social well-being. Meaningful connections with loved ones, a balanced work-life dynamic, and opportunities for personal growth contribute significantly to an individual's overall satisfaction. A focus on quality of life promotes mental and physical health, allowing individuals to enjoy the present moment and build resilience to face life's challenges.\n\nIt is essential to strike a harmonious balance between the pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of a good quality of life. Rather than viewing these goals as mutually exclusive, individuals should aim for a synergy that allows them to meet financial needs while prioritizing their well-being. Time spent with family and friends, pursuing hobbies, and engaging in activities that foster personal development should not be sacrificed solely for monetary gain.\n\nIn conclusion, the prevailing emphasis on earning money often overshadows the importance of a good quality of life. While financial stability is undoubtedly significant, it should not come at the cost of mental, emotional, and social well-being. Striking a balance between pursuing wealth and prioritizing a high quality of life is crucial for leading a fulfilling and meaningful existence in our rapidly changing world.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Too much emphasis is placed on earning money rather than looking for a good quality of life.","""In today's fast-paced world, the pursuit of wealth often takes center stage, overshadowing the equally important pursuit of a good quality of life. While financial stability is undeniably crucial for meeting basic needs and achieving certain aspirations, an excessive emphasis on earning money can lead to detrimental effects on one's overall well-being.\n\nIn the modern era, success is often equated with monetary achievements. Individuals are encouraged to climb the corporate ladder, accumulate material possessions, and engage in relentless competition. In this race for affluence, personal relationships, leisure time, and mental health can all be compromised. The pressure to earn more can result in longer working hours, increased stress levels, and a reduced ability to engage in activities that bring joy and fulfillment.\n\nConversely, a good quality of life encompasses a holistic approach that considers physical, emotional, and social well-being. Meaningful connections with loved ones, a balanced work-life dynamic, and opportunities for personal growth contribute significantly to an individual's overall satisfaction. A focus on quality of life promotes mental and physical health, allowing individuals to enjoy the present moment and build resilience to face life's challenges.\n\nIt is essential to strike a harmonious balance between the pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of a good quality of life. Rather than viewing these goals as mutually exclusive, individuals should aim for a synergy that allows them to meet financial needs while prioritizing their well-being. Time spent with family and friends, pursuing hobbies, and engaging in activities that foster personal development should not be sacrificed solely for monetary gain.\n\nIn conclusion, the prevailing emphasis on earning money often overshadows the importance of a good quality of life. While financial stability is undoubtedly significant, it should not come at the cost of mental, emotional, and social well-being. Striking a balance between pursuing wealth and prioritizing a high quality of life is crucial for leading a fulfilling and meaningful existence in our rapidly changing world.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld wrote the essay, “Why I Love my Strict Chinese Mother” to express her appreciation of having a strict Chinese mom.

Chinese mothers are often demanding and extremely stern, but it is for the good of the child. When a child is successful at something, it indicates effective parenting for the parents(s).

Nowadays people want to have the perfect job with the perfect salary to have the perfect lifestyle in order to be able to travel throughout the world, to have a good house where to live, to enjoy dinners out, but those jobs are hard to find.\r\n\r\nSome people believe that the most important is to have an enjoyable job no matter how much the salary is. A pleasant job means happiness on our daily basis, because it isn’t seen as job anymore, it’s seen as a ‘hobby’. However, in the end of the month everyone needs to have enough money to eat and to pay their bills. It’s crucial to find a job that we like and allows at least to ‘survive’ at the end of the month.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having a good lifestyle and having a salary which grant us a comfortable life is also important. In my point of view, this topic is really personal, it depends from person to person; Some people prefer to have a lower salary and a pleasant job as opposed to others who prefer to have a work which isn’t the ideal but allows them to have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nTo sum up the best of both worlds is to find a balance between a job we like where the salary is high enough to a have a good life.\n\nPeople have a different view about earning money an enjoyable work than get paid a lot.Some people believe that it is more significant to have a delightful work than to get a lot of money.Other people disagree and assume that a high income lead to greater life. \r\n\r\n   The main reason job satisfaction is so important is that it gives people a sense of satisfaction that money cannot guarantee.Even if someone receives a high salary, but feels stressed and unhappy, such a person cannot enjoy life.For example, the artist enjoys the process of painting pictures and does not always get enough money.\r\n\r\n  I make it clear that I agree with this view about getting a high salary is better rather than working on delightful job,because there is such a thing as need. So if the salary is good, then why not work. Considering that everyone has high living expenses.You have to pay taxes, utilities, buy clothes and food. For instance, an individual works in an office, a person does not like work, but he has to cover his expenses since he assumed obligations.Even if the money does not go to use, it will be possible to cover the need with it.\r\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Every single person has his or her own opinion on how to be the best parent. And there is no wrong or right in parenting.\nIt is a well-known fact that different cultures have different parenting models, and these models are not always being perceived positively by other cultures. In different cultures parents implement their own variations, which they feel will fit their family.\n\nIn the text Amy Chua tries to persuade her readers into believing that Chinese mothers are superior to Western mothers. She does that by using both statistical and personal evidence, and repeating her point. She draws parallels between the Chinese and the Western way of raising kids, but at the same time she draws a dividing line between them, because they are two very different ways of doing the same thing. She uses biased personal and statistical evidence, and purposefully fails to mention other evidence that opposes her view on parenting.\n\nAmy Chua often states in the article that the Chinese parenting model is by far the best way of raising a child, if you want your child to grow up and have success. In the article Amy Chua states that strict Western parents make their children practice their instrument for 30 minutes or so, 1 hour at most. But that is nothing compared to what she is making her kids do on a daily basis. 1 hour is like warm-up, it is the following hours that gets exhausting (Chua, 1).\nThe kids get to play their instrument as much as they want. One could say that this will affect the children positively. Their focus on success will most likely reinforce good work ethics. Others might argue that the amount of practicing is too much, and will ultimately lead to the kids not enjoying having the ability to play an instrument.\n\nKids raised by parents using the Chinese model may struggle to fit in with others raised in other\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

This shift in priorities has led to an unbalanced society where the accumulation of wealth is glorified, while aspects of life that truly contribute to overall well-being are undervalued. Striking a balance between earning money and enhancing the quality of life is crucial for a more fulfilling and sustainable existence.\n\nWhile money is undoubtedly essential for meeting basic needs and achieving certain aspirations, it should not be the sole driver of our lives. Pursuing money at the expense of personal health, meaningful relationships, and leisure time can lead to stress, burnout, and a lack of fulfillment. Society must recognize that true prosperity lies not just in material wealth but in a harmonious blend of financial security and emotional well-being.\n\nInvesting in quality of life is about prioritizing personal growth, mental health, and work-life balance. Engaging in activities that bring joy, pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, and participating in community initiatives are all integral components of a fulfilling life. Moreover, employers and organizations should promote flexible working hours and foster a positive work environment to encourage employee well-being, leading to increased productivity and loyalty.\n\nIncorporating mindfulness practices and self-care routines into daily life can significantly improve mental and emotional well-being. By developing a strong sense of self-awareness and mindfulness, individuals can better manage stress and enhance their overall quality of life.\n\nEducation and awareness are essential to addressing this imbalance. Encouraging financial literacy, ethical business practices, and a more holistic definition of success can help individuals and societies redefine their priorities. Governments and institutions should also support policies that promote well-being, such as accessible healthcare, affordable housing, and quality education, to ensure a better quality of life for all.\n\nIn conclusion, while money is undeniably necessary in today's society, placing too much emphasis on its acquisition can be detrimental to our overall well-being and happiness. Striking a balance between earning money and seeking a good quality of life is vital for a more fulfilled and prosperous society. By valuing personal growth, mental health, and meaningful connections, we can create a world where individuals thrive and find genuine contentment beyond mere financial success.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

However, the question arises: can online friendships truly replace the depth and authenticity of real-life friendships? While online interactions bring convenience and global reach, they often fall short in providing the emotional richness and shared experiences that only real friends can offer.\n\nReal friendships are built upon shared experiences, genuine emotions, and a deep understanding of each other's lives. In-person interactions allow for the nuanced expression of feelings, body language cues, and personal anecdotes that foster a profound emotional connection. These aspects are often lacking in online friendships, where text-based communication can lead to misunderstandings or a superficial portrayal of emotions.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspects of real friendships is the physical presence that enables genuine support during both joyous and challenging times. A comforting hug, a reassuring pat on the back, or simply being there in person can provide a level of support that virtual interactions cannot replicate.\n\nReal friendships are nurtured through shared experiences, whether it's laughing together, embarking on adventures, or going through life's milestones side by side. These experiences create cherished memories that contribute to the foundation of a strong friendship.\n\nTrust is a cornerstone of any friendship, and it is often developed through consistent actions and reliable support. Real friends are there when you need them, providing a level of reliability that virtual interactions struggle to match.

However, the question arises: can online friendships truly replace the depth and authenticity of real-life friendships? While online interactions bring convenience and global reach, they often fall short in providing the emotional richness and shared experiences that only real friends can offer.\n\nReal friendships are built upon shared experiences, genuine emotions, and a deep understanding of each other's lives. In-person interactions allow for the nuanced expression of feelings, body language cues, and personal anecdotes that foster a profound emotional connection. These aspects are often lacking in online friendships, where text-based communication can lead to misunderstandings or a superficial portrayal of emotions.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspects of real friendships is the physical presence that enables genuine support during both joyous and challenging times. A comforting hug, a reassuring pat on the back, or simply being there in person can provide a level of support that virtual interactions cannot replicate.\n\nReal friendships are nurtured through shared experiences, whether it's laughing together, embarking on adventures, or going through life's milestones side by side. These experiences create cherished memories that contribute to the foundation of a strong friendship.\n\nTrust is a cornerstone of any friendship, and it is often developed through consistent actions and reliable support.

An online friendshop is no substitue for real friends.","""Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's an essay on the topic \""An Online Friendship is No Substitute for Real Friends\"":\n\nIn today's digital age, the rapid advancement of technology has reshaped the way we connect and interact with others. Online platforms have provided us with unprecedented opportunities to form friendships beyond geographical boundaries. While online friendships offer convenience and a sense of connection, they cannot replace the depth and significance of real-world friendships.\n\nOne of the primary distinctions between online friendships and real friendships lies in the nature of interaction. Online interactions are often limited to text-based communication, emojis, and occasionally video calls. While these mediums facilitate communication, they lack the nuances of face-to-face interactions. Real friendships are built on shared experiences, genuine emotions, and physical presence, allowing for a deeper understanding of each other's personalities and emotions. A comforting touch, a genuine smile, or a sympathetic hug are elements that can only be fully appreciated in person.\n\nFurthermore, the depth of an online friendship may be hindered by the curated nature of online personas. Individuals tend to present a carefully selected version of themselves on social media, often omitting the complexities and vulnerabilities that are an integral part of their identity. This curated presentation can lead to a superficial connection, devoid of the authenticity that characterizes genuine friendships. In contrast, real friendships thrive on authenticity, transparency, and the ability to share one's true self without fear of judgment.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is the level of trust and reliability that real friendships inherently possess. Real friends are those we can count on in times of need, who provide emotional support, and stand by us through thick and thin. The physical presence of a friend during challenging times offers a sense of comfort and reassurance that an online conversation may not fully provide. The shared memories, laughter, and inside jokes that come with real friendships contribute to a unique bond that cannot be replicated in a digital realm.\n\nAdditionally, the fleeting nature of online connections cannot be ignored. Online friendships are susceptible to fading away due to changing circumstances, shifts in interests, or the emergence of new online connections. Without the foundation of shared experiences and face-to-face interactions, online friendships can lack the resilience and longevity that characterize real friendships.\n\nIn conclusion, while online friendships certainly have their merits in terms of convenience and global reach, they fall short in comparison to the irreplaceable value of real friendships. The depth of emotional connection, the authenticity of interaction, and the reliability of support that real friendships offer cannot be replicated in the digital sphere. As we navigate the evolving landscape of technology, it is essential to recognize the enduring significance of genuine, real-world friendships in fostering meaningful connections and enriching our lives.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People of the Gen Y and Gen Z are becoming more and more addicted to social media that they are gradually forgetting their real existence and getting detached with the outer world.\n\n The people of this generation is making friends on social media more than the physical world. This increasing use of social media is making this generation really unsocial. Though all impact of social media are not negative, still it is not a substitute of the physical world. Now a days people are making friends online. They are spending time by talking over the phone or chatting through the social media. They are so busy with their online world that they are forgetting their childhood friends. But they are not realizing that their childhood friends are those who will stay by their side in time of difficulties. It may look cool to have thousands of online friends in social media, but at the end of the day we need the ones who can be there for us in time of difficulties. \n\nAnother problem with this social media friendship  We can not recognize someone as long as we send enough time with them, and here this is the problem with this virtual world. Here nobody knows each other, we can only get to know someone only what they want us to know. Nobody will come to help us in the time of difficulties. That is why it is cool to make thousands of social media friends, but we all need some friends to stay with us out of this virtual world, whom we know very well, whom we can trust blindly, the one who will stay beside us in every ups and downs. An online friendship is no substitute of a real friendship.

This trend is driven by the belief that such experiences offer numerous benefits, from teaching valuable life skills to instilling a sense of financial responsibility. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of encouraging children to pursue part-time jobs and how these experiences can contribute to their personal and professional growth.\n\nBody:\n\nDevelopment of Essential Life Skills:\nPart-time jobs provide an excellent platform for children to learn and develop essential life skills. These skills include time management, communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. Engaging in such jobs exposes them to real-life scenarios and challenges, helping them become more resourceful and self-reliant.\n\nFinancial Literacy and Responsibility:\nTaking on a part-time job helps children understand the value of money and the importance of financial responsibility. Earning their own income teaches them to budget, save, and make informed spending decisions. This knowledge lays a strong foundation for their future financial well-being.\n\nWork Ethic and Discipline:\nA part-time job instills a sense of discipline and work ethic in children from an early age. Meeting work commitments, being punctual, and fulfilling responsibilities teach them the significance of dedication and hard work. These qualities are transferable and contribute to their academic and professional endeavors.\n\nCareer Exploration and Skill Development:\nPart-time jobs allow children to explore potential career paths and gain insight into different industries. These experiences can help them discover their strengths and interests, aiding them in making informed decisions about their future education and career choices. Moreover, they have the chance to acquire specific skills related to the job they undertake.\n\nBuilding Confidence and Independence:\nSuccessfully managing a part-time job can boost a child's self-confidence and sense of accomplishment. They learn to overcome challenges and take pride in their achievements. Additionally, working independently enhances their decision-making skills and fosters a greater sense of independence.\n\nBalancing Work and Other Commitments:\nEngaging in a part-time job while juggling school, extracurricular activities, and social interactions teaches children the importance of time management and finding a balance between various responsibilities. This skill is valuable not only in the present but also in their future endeavors.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEncouraging children to pursue part-time jobs during their free time offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to their personal and professional growth. From the development of essential life skills to the instillation of financial responsibility, these experiences provide a holistic learning platform. However, it's crucial for parents to strike a balance between work and play, ensuring that their children's well-being and education remain a priority. By fostering a supportive environment, parents can guide their children towards a path of self-discovery, confidence, and success.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

I strongly disagree with the establishment of relationships through internet because I think friends on internet friends are different from real life friends. No one knows what their purpose is. From my past experience, the relationship with internet friends does not last long because they often come and go easily. There are some negative effects\nSome parents are not aware of dangers of internet that brings to their children particularly making friends through internet. For example, their children might get cheated with someone else on internet and their children will not tell what happen to them when they encounter danger. According to BBC News, a 47 year old man defrauded a 13 year old girl online and asked to meet face to face. Luckily, the girl’s mother found out beforehand or else her daughter might be in danger. From this news, we can see that there internet friends are not always honest and they are more likely to consider as un-trustful strangers. Therefore, parents should concern more about their children, teach them about the dangers of making friends on internet, and avoid them from going out with a stranger.

A speech on friendship can be given on the occasion of friendship day or any occasion when one wants to celebrate friendship and share the role of friendship in one’s life with others. Here, we will discuss several ways of presenting a friendship speech, like a long speech on friendship and a short speech on friendship. Also, 10 lines on friendship speech in English are discussed below.Long and Short Friendship Speech in EnglishLong Speech on FriendshipA long version of a speech on friendship can be framed as follows. Very good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to deliver a speech on friendship which will take us on a walk through the streets of nostalgia and relive the precious essence of friendship that we all have experienced. Friend. That one kid who stole your candy in school or the one student who gained more marks than you in college, or the topper who taught you everything just before an exam in university. Every friend that crosses our path in life always has something to give us, be it good memories, lessons, or just something worthwhile. True friends are always there for us through thick and thin, through good or bad, and through weal and woe. True friends support us in our decisions and correct us for our well-being. Through this speech on friendship, I am delighted to extend my gratitude to all such friends I am blessed with. All types of friendships have something or the other that’s unique and special, a best friend, an acquaintance, or a group of friends. Whoever that may be, a friend should always be the one who fuels our passion to flying rather than clipping our wings. As we grow older, making new friends seems to be a tough job as we create a comfort zone of our own. So, the ones who remain friends since childhood and never give up on each other are the ones who are valuable. Friendship shouldn’t be accompanied by jealousy, ego, or insecurity. A good friendship is one where people can share all their emotions heart to heart without the fear of being judged. Although friends have numerous memories to giggle about, friendship is not only about smiles or jokes. Friends should always respect each other, understand each other and support each other throughout. No one is perfect in this world. So, insecurities and flaws just make a person complete and friends are the ones who never judge each other over each other’s flaws or insecurities, rather support each other when they get agitated due to the same. Searching for the good in people, accepting their flaws, and staying loyal help people end up being good friends. Friends are very special as we choose them to be with us and include them in our lives. So, one must make sure that they choose good ones. In this busy world, people tend to drift apart from each other due to work or other engagements. Friendships are the strongest when they reach a stage where they don't need to communicate every day to maintain the bond. In conclusion, I would like to say that with time, friends also become family and a place for us to seek closure. Such friends should be cherished and celebrated as much as possible, and gratitude should be expressed from time to time. I am so grateful to have such amazing friends who are like a family to me. I am thankful for these precious bonds that I have created over time and spending time with them makes everything better. Friendship is the only bond that survives through thick and thin.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Also, an individual can track and identify their friends’ actions on social media and the kind of posts they publish and their intentions.\nAdditionally, it has recently been found that certain social media friends are more genuine than those that individuals meet in person. Apart from that, many introverted people are uncomfortable conversing with others face to face. As a result, they turn to social media sites to meet friends and express their emotions and sentiments.

If the support of government and large institutions are available then some individuals group can do many things what ever many people can't think about that. First of all many people think about themselves only not for anybody. Because almost people are selfish. Some people believe that when you help other person then you get help by themselves. So, be helpful and careful.when they get help by governments and larger institutions then they can do many more ideas and apply their ideas and their thoughts. Please get support for human being and if you will change then you can change the world. We also can say that we can do anything but not individually.

It is believed that these changes can be made only by the government, whereas others argue that an individual can make a difference and eventually change the society. In my opinion, the influences from the former are by far more significant than that from the individuals owing to financial consideration and their authorities.\n\nIn order to initiate changes in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With strong financial foundations, governments can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific research and paying for the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development. Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, the government Awards study grants and scholarships for deserving pupils This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils.\n\nSecondly, The social influences from governments and large corporations also bring changes on a larger scale. By improving regulations and laws, governments can affect the public behaviors on a national level through civil obligation. Large corporations can influence societies too by being a leading role in their industries.This way individuals are also accountable to the responsibilities towards the betterment of a society.

This question type uses an agree, disagree scale. Essentially, an agree, disagree scale is a range of answer options that go from strongly agree to strongly disagree. It allows respondents to answer more precisely and it provides you with more nuanced survey responses to analyze. This type of question has been extremely popular among survey researchers for decades. Why?\n\nWell, they’re easy to write—and it’s a pretty standard question that’s used across industries. That being said, research has revealed some challenges with this question type. We’ll go over two such challenges and share our tips on how to overcome them in a snap.\n\n1. Avoid bias (people like to be likable)\nThe seemingly simple agree/disagree construct has what’s called an acquiescence response bias. What we mean by that is, in general, people who answer surveys like to be seen as agreeable. So they’ll say they agree when given the choice, regardless of the actual content of the question.\n\nAnother challenge is that the agree/disagree question appears to be so straightforward that researchers sometimes write a whole bunch of questions using the same answer choice options. Then, they put the questions into a matrix question type.\n\nSince an agree/disagree matrix question type packs a lot of information in a small space—it’s essentially one question that asks respondents to agree or disagree with a series of statements—respondents may not be careful about how how they answer these questions.\n\nWe call this phenomenon straight-lining. (Basically, straight-lining is when a respondent moves down a series of statements too quickly, selecting the same answer choice for all.)\n\nObviously, this is a major problem if you’re trying to collect accurate data. And, in the case of your doctor’s office, as a result of straight-lining, you won’t be able to use the data you collect to improve services and make informed decisions.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

While government and institutions do play a vital role in shaping society, it is overly simplistic to dismiss the impact that individuals can have. This essay aims to elucidate the ways in which individuals contribute to societal change, demonstrating that their actions can indeed create transformative shifts that complement the efforts of larger entities.\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that individuals have historically been instrumental in initiating and driving societal change. Throughout history, renowned figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malala Yousafzai have shown how one person's determination, vision, and activism can inspire movements that challenge the status quo. Their actions have led to transformative shifts in the realms of civil rights, social justice, and education. These individuals have demonstrated that personal agency and commitment can galvanize communities and motivate collective action.\nThe impact of individuals extends beyond the realm of grand movements. Countless individuals work tirelessly within their communities to address local issues, from volunteering at shelters to advocating for environmentally sustainable practices. These grassroots efforts, although seemingly small in scale, contribute to a broader culture of change and inspire others to participate.\nSocietal change isn't limited to policy shifts or structural modifications; it also encompasses shifts in attitudes, values, and cultural norms. Individuals play a pivotal role in challenging and reshaping these aspects of society. Artists, writers, andcultural norms. Individuals play a pivotal role in challenging and reshaping these aspects of society. Artists, writers, and thinkers often push boundaries and provoke conversations that lead to societal reflection and transformation. Their creations can alter perceptions, challenge prejudices, and foster empathy, which, in turn, influence the collective mindset.\n\nGovernment and Institutions:\nWhile individuals undoubtedly play a crucial role, the significance of government and large institutions in effecting change cannot be ignored. Their authority, resources, and ability to implement policies on a large scale are essential for addressing complex challenges. However, it's important to note that the power of these entities often relies on the momentum generated by grassroots movements and the pressure applied by concerned citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, the assertion that individuals can do nothing to change society is an oversimplification that overlooks the countless instances where individual actions have sparked societal transformation. While government and institutions do play a critical role, individuals have proven time and again that their agency, passion, and determination can initiate change, challenge norms, and inspire collective action. The symbiotic relationship between individual efforts and institutional power underscores the multifaceted nature of societal change—a collaborative endeavor where both components are indispensable.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

As for me, I strongly believe that every person should be financial responsible for illnesses which are the result of inappropriate behaviour. \n\nFirst of all, it motivates both men and women to exclude as more bad habits as they can to save their money. It is absolutely obvious that citizens who don't worry about their own condition and needs of the organism should pay additional charge for medical insurance. For example, in some countries medical companies require patients to notify if they have particular bad habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, lack of exercise and others. And the more they have the more they force to pay. Thus, it would decrease person's desire to buy harmful products or to smoke and make them to be more physically active. \n\nSecondly, it would save state resources for treating individuals with heavy deceases which were not caused by their activities. The main task of government is to provide community of basic healthcare and make it accessible to everyone. As we know, the advanced medical and surgical treatments are very expensive. For instance, sometimes we need to raise money for seriously ill people, because federal or local budgets lack to allocate funds for that purpose. Accordingly, if authorities stop spending savings for individuals which sicknesses are their own faults, it will be sufficient resources for those who don’t provoke any deceases and suffer without therapy support.

While individuals can work on the change, they can try to change the society but it takes time for that change to get into effect. A government or large institutions are basically a group of people working towards the same goal, working behind the same ideology. This essay will argue about the changes that an individual or institution can bring in the society and which one of them is more effective in bringing these changes.\n\nThere has been a saying, If any person is working on a particular goal then there is a chance that he will fail many times, before even achieving the goal. But if he try hard enough he can achieve it. The question is if that goal is big enough like changing the society. Can he do it? And how many tries will it take to even achieve that goal? The answer is it's not easy, nothing in life is. But that's the beauty of life . There is a chance that his goal may come true and there is also a chance that it may not. So we can't be sure that he can actually achieve the goal of changing the society.\n\nOn the other hand, if any organization is working on the same goal of bringing the change or introducing new thing. Then there is a certainty, that the particular change will come for example: If the concept of digital india, was only a dream of a particular individual then there may have been a chance that particular dream may not even come true. But when this dream is supported by various organization there is a change. Maybe, at some time in the future we can even hope to achieve it, it will take time but it will come true. \n\nSo the answer is change doesn't matter how big or small it is, will come true if backed up by a group of people.

While some agrue that personal actions are futile in the face of bureaucratic machinery, I believe that individuals can indeed play a pivote role in driving meaning fuk change in socitety, complementaing the efforts of larger entities.\n\nThe Power of Individuals:\n        Firstly, individuals possess  the power the power to raise awareness and ignite discussions on crucial issues. Thourgh social media, grassroots campaigns, and community organizing, individuals have demostrated their abilty to shine a spotlight on societal challenges, from environmental concerns to human right violations. Notable historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi and actions of a single indiviual societies and prompt governmental and instituational responces.\n\nThe Role Of governmeents and Large Institutions:\n          However, it would be shortsighted to discount the role of governments and discount the role of governments and large  institutions.  These entitles possess the resourses, authority, and reach necessary for implementating sweeping changes that can have lasting effects. polices, regulations, and infrastructure development are key tools weilded by governments to address societal challenges such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Additionally, institutions can marshal financial and human resources to tackle complex issues like scientific research and international diplomacy.\n\n     In conclusion, while governments and large institutions undoubtedly play a critical role in driving societal changes, the notion that individuals can do nothing to effect change is a limited perspective. the power of individuals to inspire, influence, and raise awareness, combined with the collective impact of their choices, can catalyze transformative  sfits in society can acheicve sustainable progress. As we na igate the challenge of our world, it is important too recognize the significant role that each person can play in shaping a brighter future.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Individuals can do nothing to change society.

It is believed that these changes can be made only by the government, whereas others argue that an individual can make a difference and eventually change the society. This essay will address both sides of this argument and finally reach to a conclusion with an opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, It is considered that government of every nation can make important changes in society by enforcing the law and conducting the awareness seminars. To put this in another way, people’s safety can only be ensured if the government enforces law and order in society. For instance, according to a social experiment, safety is a crucial matter in a society which is being expected by people from the ruling administration. Moreover, government should take effective steps in order to conduct the awareness seminars which will help people to aware and understand the acute problems of a society. Thus, it is clear that government plays a vital role in making a significant difference between a better and worse society.\n\nOn the other hand, Despite government aid, individuals should understand the responsibilities towards the betterment of a society. Firstly, people can change the society by actively participating in the social activities. For example, being social activists, they will understand and resolve the critical issues of the society which cannot be felt without being socialist. Secondly, youngsters should be encouraged to attain a higher education and set an example in a society for others who have been demoralized in their life. Finally, a person should be helpful and kind to others and especially to those who are needy. Therefore, it has been proven that every individual has a potential to change the society by simply encouraging and motivating themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, after discussing the both sides of an argument, in my opinion, although it should be the prime responsibility of the government in making important changes in a society, the individuals should also be matured and responsible in order to help society emerging from worse conditions and to make it a better place.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Every single person has his or her own opinion on how to be the best parent. And there is no wrong or right in parenting.\nIt is a well-known fact that different cultures have different parenting models, and these models are not always being perceived positively by other cultures. In different cultures parents implement their own variations, which they feel will fit their family.\n\nIn the text Amy Chua tries to persuade her readers into believing that Chinese mothers are superior to Western mothers. She does that by using both statistical and personal evidence, and repeating her point. She draws parallels between the Chinese and the Western way of raising kids, but at the same time she draws a dividing line between them, because they are two very different ways of doing the same thing. She uses biased personal and statistical evidence, and purposefully fails to mention other evidence that opposes her view on parenting.\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Any significant changes can only be brought about by governments and large institutions . Opinions differ on whether individuals have the same power to influence societies when compared to governments and large institutions. in my opinion, the influences from the latter are by far more significant than that from the individuals owing to financial consideration and their authorities.\nIn order to initiate changes in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With the strong financial foundations, governments and large institutions can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific researches and paying the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development. Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, students are more keen in their academic to strive for scholarships given by government and large institutions. This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils.\nThe authorities and social influences from governments and large corporations also bring changes to larger scales. By improving regulations and laws, governments can affect the public behaviors on a national level through civil obligation. Large corporations can influence the societies too by being a leading role in their industries. For instance, fair trading policies and 5-day working basis are the successful examples of raising public awareness on certain social issues.

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""The modern era has brought about a myriad of changes, affecting every aspect of society. One notable transformation is the array of challenges that young people confront today, which often differ from those faced by previous generations. This essay delves into the various pressures that contemporary youth encounter, analyzing the factors contributing to these pressures and their implications on mental health, education, and future prospects.\n                      In today's highly competitive educational landscape, young people face immense pressure to excel academically. The rising emphasis on standardized testing, college admissions, and career prospects has intensified the pursuit of high grades and academic achievements. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and even mental health issues among students, who may feel overwhelmed by the constant need to perform exceptionally.\n                 The digital age has ushered in unparalleled technological advancements that connect young people across the globe. However, this constant connectivity brings with it a unique set of pressures. The expectation to maintain a flawless online presence, coupled with the fear of missing out (FOMO) on social events and experiences, can create feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.\n                 The economic landscape has changed significantly since previous generations. Young people today often face economic instability, with the high cost of education, housing, and healthcare placing considerable financial pressure on them. The need to secure stable employment and make wise financial decisions at an earlier age can result in stress and uncertainty about the future.\n                  The pressures of modern life, combined with societal expectations, can take a toll on the mental health of young individuals. The stigma surrounding mental health may discourage them from seeking help, exacerbating issues such as depression, anxiety, and burnout. The constant comparison with others on social media can further contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.\n              Young people today face evolving societal norms and expectations. They must navigate complex issues such as gender identity, sexual orientation, and cultural diversity, which can be both liberating and challenging. The pressure to conform to traditional ideals while exploring their own identities can create a sense of internal conflict and external scrutiny.\n                The global challenges posed by climate change have placed a unique burden on young people. Many are acutely aware of the environmental crises and feel a responsibility to advocate for sustainable practices. Balancing personal aspirations with the urgency of addressing environmental issues can lead to feelings of frustration and helplessness.\n                     In conclusion, the pressures faced by young people today are multi-faceted and often distinct from those experienced by previous generations. The interplay of academic, technological, economic, and societal factors shapes their experiences and influences their mental well-being, educational paths, and future endeavors. Acknowledging these challenges and fostering a supportive environment that encourages open dialogue and mental health resources is crucial in helping young individuals navigate the complexities of the modern world.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Others think they have a much easier life than their parents did. What is your opinion?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\n\n\nIt is a well known fact that young people are the most precious asset of any country. Some people believe that young generation experience more pressure and difficulties today than in the past. Contrary to the above belief, others think that the young generation has much easier life than their parents had. In my opinion, life of young people today is not as easy as in the past. They are inundated with a number of socio-economic issues and responsibilities today.\n\nOne of the major problems faced by youth today is unemployment. Unlike in the past, when the academic success was always an open sesame to well-paid job, nowadays young people need to make an enormous effort to find jobs which are suitable for their educational background. This tendency can be attributed to intense competition, increased population and many other socio-economic changes that took place over the past few decades.\n\n\nAnother social trend that has led to increase pressure among young people is a substantial growth in elderly population. In fact, it has become a huge burden on youth to provide food, healthcare and other basic facilities for ever-growing elderly population. Consequently, they need earn a grate deal of money to fulfill these huge responsibilities. Therefore, the level of stress experienced by young people is comparatively high.\n\n\nMoreover, young people need to cope up with many new issues and challenges. Disruption of environmental balance at an alarming rate, drastic changes in weather, civil wars and emerging of new diseases are few issues which invariably create more pressures among young people. The quality of life of youth has also affected by the increased prevalence of crime rate and corruptions.\n\n\nHowever, some people believe that with the advent of new technology life of young generation has become much easier. Although new innovations help young people to do domestic and professional works without much physical effort they indirectly have increased the complexities of lives of these people.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that nowadays young people has been encountering many socio-economic problems than in the past. Therefore, the level stress among young people\n\n\nIn many countries the quality of life in the large cities is worsening What possibly can cause this problem What measures can be taken to resolve it\n83\nsticky icon\nAs populations grow and cities become more crowded, there is pressure throughout the world to construct ever-taller building to provide accommodation and offices.

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""Young people of today experience a plethora of challenges and pressures that are distinct from those faced by previous generations. The modern world has introduced a complex web of expectations, technologies, and societal changes that contribute to these heightened pressures. In this essay, I will delve into some of the key reasons why young people today grapple with more stressors compared to their predecessors.\n\nFirst and foremost, the digital age has significantly impacted the lives of young individuals. The omnipresence of social media platforms and online interactions has led to a constant need for validation and comparison. Young people today are exposed to carefully curated images and lives, which can foster feelings of inadequacy and the perception of falling short in comparison. This constant exposure to seemingly perfect lives can lead to increased stress and anxiety.\n\nMoreover, the current educational system places immense pressure on young individuals. The competition to excel academically has intensified, with the belief that higher grades equate to better opportunities. This race for success often leaves young people feeling overwhelmed, contributing to issues like burnout and mental health challenges. The expectations from parents, teachers, and society at large to excel academically and professionally can become suffocating.\n\nIn addition to academic pressures, economic uncertainties pose a significant burden. Many young people today face mounting student loan debts, a competitive job market, and the desire to secure stable financial futures. The pressure to find stable employment and the challenges of making ends meet can be daunting, impacting mental well-being.\n\nFurthermore, societal changes have also played a role in increasing pressures on young people. Changing family dynamics, increased urbanization, and shifting cultural norms can leave young individuals feeling disconnected and without a strong support system.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that young people today encounter a host of pressures that are distinct from those faced by previous generations. The digital age, academic pressures, economic uncertainties, and societal changes contribute to an environment where stressors are amplified. Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from parents, educators, policymakers, and society at large to create a more supportive and understanding environment for the young generation.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""According to some, in today's fast-paced and competitive world, children are experiencing more societal pressure compared to previous generations. I tend to agree with the opinion that today's children are living under greater societal pressure. By analyzing the increased academic expectations and the influence of social media, it becomes evident that the pressures faced by children today are indeed more pronounced.\nOne compelling reason why I believe that children face greater societal pressure today is the heightened academic expectations. In the past, academic success was important, but it was not as intensely emphasized as it is now. With the increasing emphasis on standardized testing, college admissions, and academic achievements, children today are constantly under pressure to excel academically. For instance, the competition for university placements has intensified, leading to a heightened focus on academic performance from an early age.\nAnother significant factor, in my opinion, contributing to increased societal pressure on children is the pervasive influence of social media. Unlike in the past, children today are exposed to a virtual world that puts them under constant scrutiny and comparison. Social media platforms highlight carefully curated images of success, beauty, and popularity, creating unrealistic standards that children feel compelled to meet. \nIn conclusion, the notion that today's children face more societal pressure than children in the past holds true. The increased academic expectations and the influence of social media contribute to a heightened sense of pressure and scrutiny. Parents, educators, and society as a whole need to recognize and address these pressures to ensure the well-being and healthy development of children.\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""In today's rapidly changing world, the young generation faces an unprecedented array of pressures that previous generations did not encounter. Advancements in technology, social media, increased academic expectations, economic uncertainties, and the ever-growing influence of social and peer pressure have shaped a unique landscape for today's youth. This essay explores the challenges young people confront in the modern era and highlights the significance of addressing these issues to support their well-being and growth.\n1. Academic Pressure:\nIn the pursuit of academic excellence, young people today face immense pressure to excel in their studies. The expectations to score top grades, participate in extracurricular activities, and secure scholarships or job placements can be overwhelming. This burden can lead to stress, anxiety, and even mental health issues.\n\n2. Technological Influence:\nThe omnipresence of technology and social media has brought both advantages and disadvantages. While it facilitates connectivity and access to information, it also creates a sense of constant comparison and an idealized version of life. Young people may feel pressured to keep up with the picture-perfect images projected on social media, leading to self-esteem issues.\n\n3. Economic Uncertainties:\nEconomic challenges, such as rising living costs and competitive job markets, add to the stress young people experience. Many are burdened with the pressure to secure financial stability early in life, leading to anxiety about their future.\n\n4. Social and Peer Pressure:\nYoung people today face increasing pressure to conform to societal norms and peer expectations. They may feel compelled to fit in or engage in risky behaviors to gain acceptance, leading to compromised decision-making.\n\nThe pressures faced by today's youth are undeniably complex and multifaceted. As a society, we must recognize and address these challenges to ensure the well-being and success of the younger generation. Encouraging open communication, fostering a supportive environment, promoting mental health awareness, and providing avenues for creative expression and personal growth are vital steps in helping young people navigate the pressures they encounter.\n\nEmpowering young individuals to embrace their uniqueness, build resilience, and strike a healthy work-life balance will prepare them for the dynamic challenges of the future. By fostering a positive and nurturing environment, we can create a world where young people can flourish, unleashing their full potential and contributing to a thriving society. It is the collective responsibility of parents, educators, policymakers, and communities to shape a future that empowers and uplifts the youth, helping them overcome the pressures that are characteristic of our time.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""The modern era has brought about a myriad of changes, affecting every aspect of society. One notable transformation is the array of challenges that young people confront today, which often differ from those faced by previous generations. This essay delves into the various pressures that contemporary youth encounter, analyzing the factors contributing to these pressures and their implications on mental health, education, and future prospects.\nIn today's highly competitive educational landscape, young people face immense pressure to excel academically. The rising emphasis on standardized testing, college admissions, and career prospects has intensified the pursuit of high grades and academic achievements. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and even mental health issues among students, who may feel overwhelmed by the constant need to perform exceptionally.\nThe digital age has ushered in unparalleled technological advancements that connect young people across the globe. However, this constant connectivity brings with it a unique set of pressures. The expectation to maintain a flawless online presence, coupled with the fear of missing out (FOMO) on social events and experiences, can create feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.\nThe economic landscape has changed significantly since previous generations. Young people today often face economic instability, with the high cost of education, housing, and healthcare placing considerable financial pressure on them. The need to secure stable employment and make wise financial decisions at an earlier age can result in stress and uncertainty about the future.\nThe pressures of modern life, combined with societal expectations, can take a toll on the mental health of young individuals. The stigma surrounding mental health may discourage them from seeking help, exacerbating issues such as depression, anxiety, and burnout. The constant comparison with others on social media can further contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.\nYoung people today face evolving societal norms and expectations. They must navigate complex issues such as gender identity, sexual orientation, and cultural diversity, which can be both liberating and challenging. The pressure to conform to traditional ideals while exploring their own identities can create a sense of internal conflict and external scrutiny.\nThe global challenges posed by climate change have placed a unique burden on young people. Many are acutely aware of the environmental crises and feel a responsibility to advocate for sustainable practices. Balancing personal aspirations with the urgency of addressing environmental issues can lead to feelings of frustration and helplessness.\nIn conclusion, the pressures faced by young people today are multi-faceted and often distinct from those experienced by previous generations. The interplay of academic, technological, economic, and societal factors shapes their experiences and influences their mental well-being, educational paths, and future endeavors. Acknowledging these challenges and fostering a supportive environment that encourages open dialogue and mental health resources is crucial in helping young individuals navigate the complexities of the modern world.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""The survey shows that young people are also more likely to believe childhood itself has improved, with overwhelming majorities believing that healthcare, education, and physical safety are better for today's children than for their parents' generation. Yet, despite their optimism, young people are far from naïve, expressing restlessness for action on climate change, skepticism about information they consume on social media, and struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety. They are far more likely than older people to see themselves as global citizens, and more likely to embrace international cooperation to tackle threats like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn average, nearly three-quarters of young people who are aware of climate change believe governments should take significant action to address it. The share is even higher in low- and lower-middle income countries (83 per cent) where the impact of climate change is expected to be greatest.  \nIn nearly every country surveyed, large majorities of young people report that their countries would be safer from threats like COVID-19 if governments worked in coordination with other countries rather than on their own.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""\nSome people believe that young generation experience more pressure and difficulties today than in the past. In my opinion, life of young people today is not as easy as in the past. They have a number of socio-economic issues and responsibilities today.\nOne of the major problems faced by youth today is unemployment. Unlike in the past, when the academic success was always an open sesame to well-paid job, nowadays young people need to make an enormous effort to find jobs which are suitable for their educational background. \nAnother social trend that has led to increase pressure among young people is a substantial growth in elderly population. In fact, it has become a huge burden on youth to provide food, healthcare and other basic facilities for ever-growing elderly population. Consequently, they need to earn a great deal of money to fulfill these huge responsibilities. Therefore, the level of stress experienced by young people is comparatively high.\nMoreover, young people need to cope up with many new issues and challenges. Disruption of environmental balance at an alarming rate, drastic changes in weather, civil wars and emerging of new diseases are few issues which invariably create more pressures among young people. The quality of life of youth has also affected by the increased in crime rate and corruptions.\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

As a consequence, young people today find themselves navigating a complex web of challenges and opportunities that were largely unfamiliar to previous generations. This essay aims to explore the arguments on both sides of the claim that young people today face more pressure than their predecessors.\nIncreased Pressures on Today's Youth\nAcademic Competition: The education system has become more competitive, demanding higher academic performance than ever before. The pressures of excelling in standardized tests, maintaining a high GPA, and securing a spot in esteemed institutions have intensified.\nTechnological Overload: The digital age has ushered in a barrage of stimuli, from social media platforms to instant messaging. The constant need to stay connected and the fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to a constant sense of pressure and anxiety.\nEconomic Uncertainty: The modern job market is characterized by instability and rapid change. Young people today face the challenge of not only finding meaningful employment but also adapting to evolving career paths and skill requirements.\nSocial Comparison: Social media has fueled a culture of comparison, where young individuals often measure their worth against carefully curated online personas. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and pressure to conform to unrealistic standards.\nUnique Advantages for Today's Youth\nAccess to Information and Resources: The digital age has democratized knowledge and information. Young people today have unprecedented access to educational resources, online courses, and learning platforms that empower them to acquire new skills and knowledge.\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Different types of Stress are:\n\nChronic Stress: This type of Stress is inescapable and never-ending, and this Stress generally happens due to an extremely tiring job or bad marriage. It can also be generated if the person remembers their past traumatic experiences.\nEpisodic Acute Stress: This Stress is treated in the short term and could act as a positive for the person. This Stress is very common among people, and people experience it very often. This Stress is generated due to certain events that have occurred in their ongoing life.\nEustress: This Stress is exciting and amazing. It is related to the flow of adrenaline. It is treated as positive Stress that keeps people energetic.\nCause of Stress\nA lot of factors contribute to generating Stress in a person's life. Some major causes of Stress are parenting, relationships, pressurized work, financial problems, and inconvenient day-to-day activities.\n\nStress happens as a response to these challenges, and certain hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are released in this process. Experts say that Stress is a response to a perceived threat. When this perception is passed, the mind automatically goes to a relaxation response. This relaxation response is seldom generated in the body as the body is constantly fighting the perceived notion of threat. Stress can turn people to adopt unhealthy habits. For example, people start smoking or eating too muchto avoid Stress.

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""To begin with, one of the reasons this phenomenon took place is the increasing competitiveness of the modern world. The recent criteria are tougher and tougher, which means that more allotted time by humans is required. While young people tend to invest a lot of their time in things such as academics or work, older people have usually a family and more affairs to deal with. Thus the productivity of young people is higher, resulting in a more implicated and influent generation.\n\nSecondly, the modern environment is in continuous change, which means that people nowadays must adapt quicker and better. As an example, take the accent which is put on multi-disciplinary, lifelong training, or the fact that students are prepared for jobs that do not merely exist yet. All these are supported better by younger people, and the invaluable proof is, for example, the shrewdness with which a child learns how to work on a computer, an action almost impossible for some adults. Considering these abilities of adoption, it becomes obvious why young people tend to occupy more and more important places in society.\n\nConversely, the young generation may become disrespectful to adults, on the basis of their achievements. The youngster especially may consider that they do not have anything to learn from older people, resulting in a continuous intellectual falling.\n\nOverall, the adaptation capacities alongside with the fact that young people have more time to spend are the main reasons for youngers' power. The consequence may be, unfortunately, quite bad.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

The top 1% richest people dominate more than 70% of the global wealth, which would be definitely beyond imagination 50 years ago. Secondly, the employment opportunities have been decreasing for nearly 3 years, while the number of university graduates has been increasing at the same time. In other words, the competition in labour market has been increasingly fierce and it will be more and more difficult for young people to find a job in near future. Thirdly, the cost for forming a family is rising as well, including the price of real estate, the expense on education, the cost of medical care. Under such circumstances, more young people will tend to keep single and refuse marriage, leading to more bankrupt of companies in related industries, which will bring about fewer job opportunities and lower income. In comparison, the phonomena above did not exist decades ago, when young people in those generations were less stressful.\nNonetheless, young people today do have the chance to enjoy more advanced electronic equipment, more delicious food, more convenient transportation and so on. 50 years ago, no one at that time could have, or even imagine, the personal computer, laptop, cell phones and video games.\nTherefore, in summary, young people today are facing more stress than before, though they can enjoy modern life that never existed before.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""The world we live in today is vastly different from what it was just a few decades ago. With the advent of technology, globalization, and rapid societal changes, young people are encountering a unique set of challenges and pressures that previous generations did not have to contend with. This essay explores the reasons why young people today face more pressure than their predecessors, focusing on academic, economic, social, and mental health pressures. One of the primary sources of pressure on young people today is the intense academic competition. The emphasis on education as a means to secure a better future has never been stronger. Students are expected to excel academically from an early age, and the fear of falling behind or not meeting expectations can be overwhelming. The pressure to maintain high grades, participate in extracurricular activities, and build an impressive resume for college admissions creates an immense burden on young minds. Moreover, the prevalence of standardized testing and a \""one-size-fits-all\"" approach to education can stifle individual creativity and lead to a narrow focus on academic achievements. This constant pressure to succeed can result in burnout and anxiety among young students, impacting their mental well-being. The economic landscape has evolved significantly, and young people today face a challenging job market. The rise of automation and advancements in technology have altered the employment landscape, making job opportunities scarcer in certain fields. Additionally, the cost of education has skyrocketed, leaving many burdened with substantial student debt before they even enter the workforce. The dream of owning a home or achieving financial stability, which was more attainable for previous generations, has become increasingly elusive for young people today. The pressure to secure a well-paying job to support themselves and potentially a family can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress and anxiety about their financial future. In the age of social media, young people face a new dimension of social pressures that previous generations did not encounter. The constant exposure to curated images of success, beauty, and happiness on platforms like Instagram and Facebook can create unrealistic expectations and comparisons. The fear of missing out (FOMO) and the desire to be constantly validated through likes and shares can take a toll on mental health. Cyberbullying and online harassment are also prevalent issues that young people have to navigate, leading to heightened anxiety and depression. While mental health has always been a concern, there is a growing awareness of its importance today. Young people are more open about their struggles with mental health, which is a positive step towards reducing stigma. However, this openness also exposes them to additional pressures, as they are expected to cope with their emotions and seek help effectively. The fast-paced, always-connected lifestyle of today's world can exacerbate stress and anxiety levels. The pressure to perform well academically, socially, and professionally, combined with the constant exposure to digital devices, can lead to burnout and mental health issues. Young people today undoubtedly face more pressure than previous generations, driven by factors such as academic competition, economic uncertainty, social media, and mental health awareness. It is crucial for society to recognize these pressures and work towards creating a supportive environment that fosters holistic growth and well-being. Encouraging a more flexible approach to education, addressing economic disparities, promoting healthy social media habits, and investing in mental health support are essential steps to help the younger generation navigate the challenges of the modern world successfully. By doing so, we can empower them to lead fulfilling lives and create a more resilient and compassionate society for generations to come.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

They are individuals with dreams and aspiration, they are positive and have passion for what they do. Some succeed while some just lose their way because of certain expectations that have been endowed to them by their parents and their adults\n\nYouths of todays have a good and easy upbringing than the old times where even medical facilities were hard to get. The previous generations had to go long road just to attend the school and since the country was not developed and population was a bit less there were many opportunities for them. They could go into trade from one village to another. Though their early years of upbringing may be tough they tide through it will power and grit. This really makes their mind stronger and they were more confident in what they do . problem that they faced while they were small the problems then faced when they started working seems way lighter.\n\nAbout the current generations, which are the today youths are kind of weak in will power but their imaginations are quite big, they are innovate in their own way and can do work more efficiently but they are a bit weak in their mindset.

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""It is a well known fact that young people are the most precious asset of any country. Some people believe that young generation experience more pressure and difficulties today than in the past. Contrary to the above belief, others think that the young generation has much easier life than their parents had. In my opinion, life of young people today is not as easy as in the past. They are inundated with a number of socio-economic issues and responsibilities today.\n\nOne of the major problems faced by youth today is unemployment. Unlike in the past, when the academic success was always an open sesame to well-paid job, nowadays young people need to make an enormous effort to find jobs which are suitable for their educational background. This tendency can be attributed to intense competition, increased population and many other socio-economic changes that took place over the past few decades.\n\n\nAnother social trend that has led to increase pressure among young people is a substantial growth in elderly population. In fact, it has become a huge burden on youth to provide food, healthcare and other basic facilities for ever-growing elderly population. Consequently, they need earn a grate deal of money to fulfill these huge responsibilities. Therefore, the level of stress experienced by young people is comparatively high.\n\n\nMoreover, young people need to cope up with many new issues and challenges. Disruption of environmental balance at an alarming rate, drastic changes in weather, civil wars and emerging of new diseases are few issues which invariably create more pressures among young people. The quality of life of youth has also affected by the increased prevalence of crime rate and corruptions.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Young people today face more pressure than in previous generations.","""Young people today are now facing more pressure than ever before.\nFirstly, compared to previous generations, younger folks are under pressure to fulfil more expectations. This means that younger people are expected to achieve more, get high grades, go to good colleges, get a good job, have their own business, etc. from the moment they enter school. So much pressure is put on their shoulders from such a young age that they get no time to rest or discover themselves or their passion. While previous generations not only had time to spend, but weren’t expected to do anything other than marry, breed, and live their day-to-day lives.\nSecond, young people are not supported emotionally through their struggles. Their parents view mental health as a taboo topic and raise their children to consider it as such. Thus, when someone starts struggling, they are shunned by society, and isolate themselves since no one is there for them to provide support or recommend professional help, leading the younger generation to turn into drugs, unsafe coping mechanisms, depression, nihilism, and in some unfortunate cases, suicide.\nThirdly, young people are exposed to the harsh realities of life. Whether they are using their phones, TVs, PCs, etc. they are always bombarded with news from all around the global. Sometimes it’s news about a disease emerging from China, other times it’s a mass shooting in the United States of America, sometimes it is about war crimes committed in Africa or the Middle East, and other times, it’s about the rape and death of innocents in their own home country. So much negative news enters the minds of our children, poisoning them, and making them feel truly helpless to the harsh world they live in.\nTo wrap up, young people are bearing too much pressure on their shoulders compared to previous generations. Whether it’s the high expectations they are supposed to achieve, exposure to constant depressive news, or lack of support through all their struggles, they deserve to be cut some slack, for they are seeing too much at such a young age.\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

This will surely enable them to appreciate the hard work of their parents and children will try to          share some of the responsibilities. They will understand the need for sharing and      caring. Working in a team will help children understand the             importance of interdependence and accepting the peers. A part time job also gives them a taste of their future life and will help them to organise their life in a disciplined manner and teach them how to balance personal life and work\n\nOn the other hand, non availability of free time will affect the mental and physical            development of children. They will be forced to go to work after school hours and the         valuable time they get to play and remould their fine motor skills will be reduced. The chance to earn money at a young age will also result in social and moral issues among          children. Since they don’t know how to manage the financial matters, they will utilize it for anti social activities such as smoking, alcohol consumption. The part time job will      also reduce their opportunities to interact with their peers of same age.\n\nIn conclusion, even though a part time job is beneficial for nurturing in children qualities like             interdependence, self confidence and courage to face real life situations, it may affect the mental and physical development of children. The knowledge and enthusiasm they get while reading stories and interacting with peers should not be compromised for other things.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Doing part-time job at an early stage of life not only teaches them the importance of earning money, but also prevents them from being a spendthrift. For instance, during my college days, I used to take part-time tuition classes which taught me to save my hard-earned money. Further, working part time also makes the children a responsible person.

This part-time job is also an extra source of income for the household and it can even help with some of the financial problems of the family. There is also the flip side to the argument that getting a part-time job is a waste of time. Some people believe that getting a part-time job will ruin their free time and they won't get time enough to relax or do a hobby they did in their free time. My take is that we should balance everything and take a part-time job. This can help one even if he/she lives alone with all the financial problems and a person can always take out time to do the things they love. It increases a person's experience and opens up more job opportunities with companies that only hire experienced professionals. If a person is not doing anything in their free time then this can help them get out of a boring place. Getting a job helps with accepting responsibilities and carrying them out. It also helps with getting out of the lazy zone which prevents anything from being done.

Many children are encouraged by their parents to get a part time job in their free time.","""The concept of children engaging in part-time employment during their free time is a topic that sparks discussions and considerations. Supporters argue that such an experience can offer a range of practical advantages and life skills beyond the classroom setting.\n\nParticipating in a part-time job can foster a sense of responsibility and time management. Juggling schoolwork and job commitments necessitates effective scheduling, aiding children in honing skills that will prove valuable throughout their lives. Furthermore, such jobs can introduce children to financial responsibility and the importance of budgeting.\n\nBeyond skill development, part-time jobs provide children with a glimpse into the professional world. Early exposure can help them understand workplace dynamics, expectations, and the value of teamwork. These encounters may influence their career aspirations and prepare them for future endeavors.\n\nHowever, there are potential drawbacks to consider. Balancing work and academics might lead to fatigue and negatively affect academic performance. The stress of managing both commitments could detract from the benefits of part-time employment. Additionally, children may miss out on recreational activities and the chance to relax, which are integral to their well-rounded development.\n\nParents must assess their child's capabilities and existing commitments before advocating for part-time work. The nature of the job, hours required, and potential impact on academics and personal time should all be weighed. Dialogue between parents, children, and school authorities is crucial to strike a suitable equilibrium.\n\nIn conclusion, while encouraging children to undertake part-time jobs has merits""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Many children are encouraged by their parents to get a part time job in their free time.","""Having a Few hours job in a week at the early age of childhood stage  can teach a valuable  lesson in a life to become better individuals in a modern society. Nowadays, it is a true fact that most of the parents are motivating their kids to do a part time job during their leisure time which will boost the career growth of their kids. However, this has some positive and negative effects on children's lives. In this essay I will shed some light on the pros and cons of working at a very early age. \nTo begin with this, having the Few hour jobs at an early age leads to the positive development of an individual. When children work hard to manage a  Part time job and their school studies, they became more confident, independent and hard working by working under pressure  which helps them a lot to build up a career. They also understand the importance of money and how to become financially strong by spending funds properly, which is very fruitful for their future. To illustrate more, a recent by Toronto University showed that 80% Canadians  are more confident and independent in a professional life due to having a Part time work during their childhood stage.\nOn the other hand, despite all the merits of a part time job has some demerits a well. Children  will have more burden to manage study tasks while working. It can lead to reduce their performance in the grade of their academics due to shortages of time. Moreover, they will have less Leisure time to spend with their family and to perform sports activities which is significantly important to their mental and physical growth.  For an example, a recent study by Queen's university states that in Canada many teenagers are week in academic in Canada due the burden of job while attending school.

Although it aids in instilling confidence and the habit of hard effort in children, it also has significant disadvantages.\nPart-time employment will firstly assist the kids in comprehending. In addition, it will also allow them to experience the challenges and sufferings their parents go through on a daily basis in order to raise them. Children will attempt to share some of the obligations, and they will be able to appreciate the effort put forward by their parents as a result. They will recognise the value of giving and caring. Children will learn the value of interdependence and accepting their peers by participating in group activities.\nA part-time job also gives them a taste of their future and teaches them how to discipline their lives, and organise them. Further, learn to strike a balance between their personal and professional lives.\nOn the other hand, children's mental and physical growth would be hampered by a lack of leisure time. They won't have as much time to play and develop their fine motor skills because they will be required to work after school. Children's social and moral problems will increase as a result of the opportunity to earn money at a young age. They will use their lack of financial management skills to indulge in antisocial behaviours like drinking and smoking.\nAdditionally, part-time employment will limit their chances to socialise with their age-group friends.\nA part-time job can help children develop traits like interdependence, self-confidence, and the fortitude to tackle challenges in real life.

This trend is driven by the belief that such experiences offer numerous benefits, from teaching valuable life skills to instilling a sense of financial responsibility. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of encouraging children to pursue part-time jobs and how these experiences can contribute to their personal and professional growth.\n\nDevelopment of Essential Life Skills:\nPart-time jobs provide an excellent platform for children to learn and develop essential life skills. These skills include time management, communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. Engaging in such jobs exposes them to real-life scenarios and challenges, helping them become more resourceful and self-reliant.\n\nFinancial Literacy and Responsibility:\nTaking on a part-time job helps children understand the value of money and the importance of financial responsibility. Earning their own income teaches them to budget, save, and make informed spending decisions. This knowledge lays a strong foundation for their future financial well-being.\n\nWork Ethic and Discipline:\nA part-time job instills a sense of discipline and work ethic in children from an early age. Meeting work commitments, being punctual, and fulfilling responsibilities teach them the significance of dedication and hard work. These qualities are transferable and contribute to their academic and professional endeavors.\n\nCareer Exploration and Skill Development:\nPart-time jobs allow children to explore potential career paths and gain insight into different industries. These experiences can help them discover their strengths and interests, aiding them in making informed decisions about their future education and career choices. Moreover, they have the chance to acquire specific skills related to the job they undertake.\n\nBuilding Confidence and Independence:\nSuccessfully managing a part-time job can boost a child's self-confidence and sense of accomplishment. They learn to overcome challenges and take pride in their achievements. Additionally, working independently enhances their decision-making skills and fosters a greater sense of independence.\n\nBalancing Work and Other Commitments:\nEngaging in a part-time job while juggling school, extracurricular activities, and social interactions teaches children the importance of time management and finding a balance between various responsibilities. This skill is valuable not only in the present but also in their future endeavors.\n\nEncouraging children to pursue part-time jobs during their free time offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to their personal and professional growth. From the development of essential life skills to the instillation of financial responsibility, these experiences provide a holistic learning platform. However, it's crucial for parents to strike a balance between work and play, ensuring that their children's well-being and education remain a priority. By fostering a supportive environment, parents can guide their children towards a path of self-discovery, confidence, and success.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Parents, who play a pivotal role in shaping their children's future, are increasingly recognizing the value of encouraging their offspring to engage in part-time employment during their free time. This essay explores the advantages of such a practice, highlighting how part-time jobs can contribute to a child's personal growth, skill development, financial literacy, and future career prospects.\n\n\nPersonal Growth and Responsibility: Engaging in part-time jobs introduces children to real-world responsibilities and challenges. This experience fosters personal growth by teaching them discipline, time management, and accountability. Balancing school, extracurricular activities, and work helps youngsters develop a strong work ethic, setting the foundation for a successful adulthood.\n\nSkill Development: Part-time jobs offer children the opportunity to acquire a range of practical skills that extend beyond the classroom. They learn to communicate effectively, solve problems, handle customer service situations, and work in a team. These skills are invaluable and contribute to their overall development By earning their own money through part-time jobs, children gain insights into financial management. They learn to budget, save, and understand the value of hard-earned income. This early exposure to financial responsibility prepares them for the fiscal challenges they will encounter later in life.\n\nPart-time jobs enable children to explore various career options firsthand. They can test their interests and aptitudes in different industries, helping them make more informed decisions about their future career paths. This practical experience aids in narrowing down potential career choices and identifying areas of passion.\n Balancing school, work, and personal commitments forces children to master time management skills. Learning to allocate time efficiently between various activities is a skill that will serve them well throughout their lives. This experience contributes to their academic success and future professional endeavors.\n\n Part-time jobs require interaction with diverse individuals, from colleagues to customers. This fosters the development of strong interpersonal skills, empathy, and effective communication. Such skills are essential for forming successful relationships and navigating the complexities of the adult world.\n\n\nEncouraging children to pursue part-time jobs during their free time can have a profoundly positive impact on their personal and professional development. The benefits of personal growth, skill acquisition, financial literacy, career exploration, time management, and enhanced social skills all contribute to a well-rounded and capable individual. By allowing children to experience the responsibilities of the real world at an early age, parents empower them with valuable life lessons that will contribute to their success in adulthood.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""It is often said that earlier technological advancements drove more benefits, and changed the lives of general citizens more profoundly than contemporary technological developments. I, however, fundamentally disagree with the perception and put forward the view that recent technological advancements confer more advantage than perhaps ever before.\n\nFor a start, the most decisive advantage of recent technological advances is information storage and information for all. In the past, technology was confined in research labs and ordinary people had very little to do with them. University and education were for aristocratic people which we can now access without even leaving our room. Digital devices were mostly owned by rich people and ordinary people worked manually to complete their tasks. Besides, technological devices, nowadays, enable the storage of tremendous amounts of information in relatively small spaces and they are affordable. Most information is publicly available and the internet is connecting all from every corner of the world.\n\nLikewise, another amazing benefit of recent digital technology that is almost taken for granted is the versatility. These devices in fact are ridiculously versatile. The smartphones, for instance, which are owned by even lower-middle-class and poor people, is a great example of how modern technology have changed the way people work, communicate, live and plan their life. In the past, it was impossible to think a factory worker owning a powerful computer to access important data. Furthermore, modern technology is meant to connect ordinary people and they are the primary consumers, unlike the past when affluent people could afford the latest gizmos and technology.\n\nIn the same token, social connectivity is another revolutionary advantage of contemporary digital technology. The cutting-edge technology makes it convenient to remain in touch with family, friends, and work remotely, even though they are in another part of the globe. They are able to communicate through audio, video, and texts. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, small software, and apps have all been devised to help us to socialize, do banking, shopping and meet people.\n\nFrom the discussion above, it proves to be reasonable to conclude that contemporary digital technology is far better, more powerful and affordable than that of the past. They are also connecting all so that people from all walks of life can reap the benefits of modern technology.\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""\n\nThe impact of technological development on the lives of ordinary people has been profound, with earlier advancements bringing more immediate and transformative benefits compared to recent developments. Throughout history, innovations such as the printing press, steam engine, and electricity revolutionized various aspects of society, enabling greater access to information, improved transportation, and enhanced communication.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the invention of the steam engine powered mechanized production, transforming economies and creating new job opportunities for individuals in factories. The printing press facilitated the spread of knowledge and ideas, empowering people with education and information that were previously accessible only to the elite. Similarly, the widespread adoption of electricity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized daily life by providing reliable lighting, powering appliances, and enabling the growth of industries.\nIn recent times, technological developments have been more incremental and focused on digital advancements. While the internet and smartphones have connected the world and enhanced communication, their impact might not be as immediately transformative as earlier innovations. Many recent developments, such as social media platforms and advanced algorithms, have raised concerns about privacy, mental health, and social interactions.\nMoreover, the benefits of recent technological advancements might not be evenly distributed among ordinary people due to issues of access, affordability, and education. The digital divide, for instance, highlights the disparities in technology access between different socioeconomic groups.\nIn conclusion, earlier technological developments brought about more dramatic and wide-ranging benefits to the lives of ordinary people compared to recent advancements. While recent technologies have certainly brought changes, they often come with their own set of challenges and are sometimes not as universally transformative as innovations from the past. It's essential to consider both the positive and negative aspects of technological progress as we navigate the evolving landscape of innovation.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""Developments in technology over many years have dramatically changed the world that we live in, and some people think that earlier advances in technology have had a greater impact on and been more beneficial to the lives of ordinary people than more recent changes. However, I partially agree with this as the advantages and influences on people’s lives actually depends on the particular area of technology.\n\nThere is no doubt that some earlier advances in technology have been very influential, such as those related to technology around the home. Devices such as washing machines, fridges and freezers, central heating, microwaves and televisions were invented many years ago, and now nearly every household has all or some of these in their home, making life much easier. Though they have been improved over time, they still carry out much the same purpose as when they were first invented. \n\nAnother example is that of medicine. Despite the fact that there have been ground-breaking recent medical developments, such as that connected to research into genes and stem cells, the benefits to the average person are still many years away. The most influential impacts on health have been earlier technological developments of the past, which remain today. These are the ability to treat so many injuries and diseases and carry out organ transplants in hospitals. It is these that have benefits on so many lives and will for decades to come. \n\nHowever, if we look at some more recent developments, they have had a much greater influence than in the past. For instance, there is the phone, which was a significant development when invented helping many people. However, although invented many years ago, technological developments over the last few decades have enabled the phone to now be mobile and connected to the internet. This has had incredible impacts on the way people Iive their lives with people using phones for so many everyday activities and for connecting around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that although some older technological developments are important, some new ones are too. The impacts on ordinary people’s lives therefore depends on the type of technology in question.

Development is essentially the process that takes a product or idea from a hypothesis to a usable product. More often than not, development is usually restarted after a product is finished, which is known as a prototype, which means it was a testing to determine if the technology was ready for regular usage.\n\nAn example of this was laser technology; back 60 years ago, they were most likely tested in a secret lab funded by the government, most likely for military application. Once it passed R&D (research and development), prototypes were sent out to be field tested. They were large, probably the size of something you could fit on the back of a flatbed.\n\nEventually, the tech became more condensed and was modified to more portable applications, such as range finders, laser designators and aim assistance for long arms. By the late 70s, the public eye was able to SLOWLY get the technology. Roll ahead thirty years and lasers are micro sized and used for surgery, printing etc.\n\nThat’s just an example in a nutshell of developme""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

The printing press democratized knowledge dissemination, allowing information to spread rapidly and empowering the masses. Electricity transformed homes and industries, enhancing productivity and improving the quality of life.\n\nDrawbacks of Earlier Technological Developments:\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge that earlier technological advancements also had downsides. Industrialization led to harsh working conditions and income inequalities. Rapid urbanization strained infrastructure and led to overcrowding.\n\nBenefits of Recent Technological Developments:\nIn recent times, technological innovations like the internet, smartphones, and renewable energy sources have reshaped society. The internet has democratized information access, enabling global communication and e-commerce. Smartphones have made communication portable and accessible, enhancing connectivity and knowledge-sharing. Renewable energy sources promise to address environmental challenges and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.\n\nDrawbacks of Recent Technological Developments:\nNevertheless, recent technological developments have introduced new challenges. The digital divide exacerbates inequalities, leaving some without access to the benefits of the internet. Social media addiction and privacy concerns have arisen from the excessive use of smartphones. While renewable energy offers promise, its widespread adoption faces infrastructural and economic obstacles.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, both earlier and recent technological developments have had profound impacts on ordinary lives, bringing benefits and challenges alike. Earlier innovations set the foundation for modern society, while recent advancements continue to shape our world. The key lies in harnessing the positives while addressing the negatives of technological progress. Ultimately, it is not a matter of whether earlier or recent developments were more impactful, but how we navigate the evolving landscape of technology to create a more equitable and sustainable future.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""Technological breakthroughs have indeed a huge impact on people’s everyday lives. However, it is considered that advancements on earlier technology have more significant benefits on majority as compared with the latest discoveries and inventions these could ever offer. On my point of view, even though it is obvious that previous developments are continuously helping our lives, I still believe that the recent ones would definitely change our daily living and probably we will be dependent on these in the near future as well.\nGiven the appliances and gadgets that we have on our homes, for example, our washing machine, vacuum cleaner, telephones and television, these are inventions in the past that are continuously improving to make our lives better. Most of these things are improvised to a smart devices which help us lessen the manual efforts we do to complete a certain task like cleaning & drying. Moreover, our telephones and tv become smart mobile phones & tv which can now be connected to the internet which allows us to communicate even from the farthest corner of the earth. Smart TVs, likewise, provide us more choices of shows for entertainment. Having said that, it is undoubtedly accurate that these technologies have definitely improve the way we live.\nHowever, it is supported by some that recent technology and developments that are taken in place would not benefit humanity like what the earlier technology has been doing. As opposed to this, inventions & discoveries like GPS, mobile applications, robotics automation, artificial intelligence are still for continuous research and study for the betterment of everyone’s life, including the ordinary ones. For instance, mobile application are available and are helping nowadays for our transportation, shopping and entertainment which are almost impossible before to think that it would fit in a pocket for just a click from a small gadget. Automation & artificial intelligence were just a thing in private companies before, like business and healthcare establishments which eliminates manual and clerical process and even aid in the field of medicine and surgery. Nevertheless, it becomes almost available as well in our homes like applications namely Siri, Alexa, Bixby & Google which we use their intelligence to help us in our certain part of our daily lives. \nIn conclusion, though the recent developments are still under study, I believe that it will eventually impact our lives just like the earlier inventions that makes our lives easier. Just like other technologies, these will eventually become cheaper that would also allow ordinary people to have access on it and makes lives more comfortable.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.",""" It is often said that earlier technological advancements drove more benefits, and changed the lives of general citizens more profoundly than contemporary technological developments. I, however, fundamentally disagree with the perception and put forward the view that recent technological advancements confer more advantage than perhaps ever before.\nFor a start, the most decisive advantage of recent technological advances is information storage and information for all. In the past, technology was confined in research labs and ordinary people had very little to do with them. University and education were for aristocratic people which we can now access without even leaving our room. Digital devices were mostly owned by rich people and ordinary people worked manually to complete their tasks. Besides, technological devices, nowadays, enable the storage of tremendous amounts of information in relatively small spaces and they are affordable. Most information is publicly available and the internet is connecting all from every corner of the world.\n\nLikewise, another amazing benefit of recent digital technology that is almost taken for granted is the versatility. These devices in fact are ridiculously versatile. The smartphones, for instance, which are owned by even lower-middle-class and poor people, is a great example of how modern technology have changed the way people work, communicate, live and plan their life. In the past, it was impossible to think a factory worker owning a powerful computer to access important data. Furthermore, modern technology is meant to connect ordinary people and they are the primary consumers, unlike the past when affluent people could afford the latest gizmos and technology.\n\nIn the same token, social connectivity is another revolutionary advantage of contemporary digital technology. The cutting-edge technology makes it convenient to remain in touch with family, friends, and work remotely, even though they are in another part of the globe. They are able to communicate through audio, video, and texts. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, small software, and apps have all been devised to help us to socialize, do banking, shopping and meet  people \n\nFrom the discussion above, it proves to be reasonable to conclude that contemporary digital technology is far better, more powerful and affordable than that of the past. They are also connecting all so that people from all walks of life can reap the benefits of modern technology.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""Earlier technological developments brought significant benefits and transformative changes to the lives of ordinary people, surpassing the impacts of more recent technological advancements. These earlier innovations played a crucial role in shaping society, enhancing human capabilities, and revolutionizing various aspects of daily life.\n\nThe industrial revolution, for instance, marked a pivotal era in history when innovations like the steam engine and mechanized manufacturing processes led to unprecedented economic growth. These advancements not only created job opportunities but also improved living standards by making goods more affordable and accessible. Similarly, the invention of electricity and the telephone brought about remarkable societal changes, connecting people across vast distances and enabling the rapid exchange of information.\n\nMoreover, earlier technologies often had a profound impact on essential sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation. The introduction of agricultural machinery, like the plow and tractor, revolutionized farming practices and increased food production, contributing to the overall well-being of societies. Medical breakthroughs such as the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines significantly reduced mortality rates and extended human lifespans.\n\nIn contrast, recent technological developments, while undoubtedly transformative, may not have yielded comparable benefits to ordinary people. The proliferation of smartphones, social media platforms, and other digital innovations has revolutionized communication and connectivity. However, concerns about privacy, mental health, and the digital divide have emerged as potential drawbacks of these advancements. The rapid evolution of automation and artificial intelligence has also raised concerns about job displacement and societal inequality.\n\nFurthermore, the pace of recent technological developments has often outstripped society's ability to adapt and address the ethical, social, and environmental implications they bring. This stands in contrast to earlier technologies, which often underwent more gradual implementation, allowing societies to better navigate their effects.\n\nIn conclusion, earlier technological developments played a pivotal role in shaping societies and improving the lives of ordinary people through innovations that revolutionized industries and transformed daily life. While recent technology advancements have also brought about significant changes, they may not have yielded comparable benefits due to concerns over their societal impacts and the rapid pace of their introduction. As we continue to advance, it is essential to carefully consider the broader implications of technology on society and prioritize the well-being of all individuals.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.",""" It  is often said that earlier technological advancements drove more benefits, and changed the lives of general citizens more profoundly than contemporary technological developments. I, however, fundamentally disagree with the perception and put forward the view that recent technological advancements confer more advantage than perhaps ever before.\n\nFor a start, the most decisive advantage of recent technological advances is information storage and information for all. In the past, technology was confined in research labs and ordinary people had very little to do with them. University and education were for aristocratic people which we can now access without even leaving our room. Digital devices were mostly owned by rich people and ordinary people worked manually to complete their tasks. Besides, technological devices, nowadays, enable the storage of tremendous amounts of information in relatively small spaces and they are affordable. Most information is publicly available and the internet is connecting all from every corner of the world.\n\nLikewise, another amazing benefit of recent digital technology that is almost taken for granted is the versatility. These devices in fact are ridiculously versatile. The smartphones, for instance, which are owned by even lower-middle-class and poor people, is a great example of how modern technology have changed the way people work, communicate, live and plan their life. In the past, it was impossible to think a factory worker owning a powerful computer to access important data. Furthermore, modern technology is meant to connect ordinary people and they are the primary consumers, unlike the past when affluent people could afford the latest gizmos and technology.\n\nIn the same token, social connectivity is another revolutionary advantage of contemporary digital technology. The cutting-edge technology makes it convenient to remain in touch with family, friends, and work remotely, even though they are in another part of the globe. They are able to communicate through audio, video, and texts. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, small software, and apps have all been devised to help us to socialize, do banking, shopping and meet people.\n\nFrom the discussion above, it proves to be reasonable to conclude that contemporary digital technology is far better, more powerful and affordable than that of the past. They are also connecting all so that people from all walks of life can reap the benefits of modern technology.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Earlier technological developments brought more benefits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments.","""Developments in technology over many years have dramatically changed the world that we live in, and some people think that earlier advances in technology have had a greater impact on and been more beneficial to the lives of ordinary people than more recent changes. However, I partially agree with this as the advantages and influences on people’s lives actually depends on the particular area of technology.\n\nThere is no doubt that some earlier advances in technology have been very influential, such as those related to technology around the home. Devices such as washing machines, fridges and freezers, central heating, microwaves and televisions were invented many years ago, and now nearly every household has all or some of these in their home, making life much easier. Though they have been improved over time, they still carry out much the same purpose as when they were first invented. \n\nAnother example is that of medicine. Despite the fact that there have been ground-breaking recent medical developments, such as that connected to research into genes and stem cells, the benefits to the average person are still many years away. The most influential impacts on health have been earlier technological developments of the past, which remain today. These are the ability to treat so many injuries and diseases and carry out organ transplants in hospitals. It is these that have benefits on so many lives and will for decades to come. \n\nHowever, if we look at some more recent developments, they have had a much greater influence than in the past.

However, the benefits and changes\nbrought by the earlier technological developments to the lives of ordinary people\ncannot compare with those brought by recent ones. Therefore, I disagree with the\ngiven statement. In the following paragraphs, I intend to support my opinion with my\narguments.\nUndoubtedly, recent technological developments have benefited and changed our life\nso much that we enjoy almost all the comforts and conveniences that life can ever\noffer. Today, we can breakfast in Japan, lunch in Singapore and dine at New Delhi. This\nis all because of the faster means of travel. The Internet has revolutionised\ncommunication. Today we send and receive e-mails at the click of a mouse. We chat\nand do video conferencing with our kith and kin in any part of the world. These are\njust two examples of how dramatically recent technological developments have\nbenefited and changed our life.\nFurthermore, in the field of medicine, we have gadgets to diagnose cancers and many\nother diseases at such early stages that almost complete cures are possible. Also, if we\nlook at the means we use to go to work, the electrical appliances we use at home, the\ndevices we use in offices, the facilities and equipments we use in factories, we can say\nwith certainty that recent technology has transformed our lives beyond imagination.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

While science is concerned with understanding how and why things happen, technology deals with making things happen.\n\nDevelopment is closely related with technology. The stage of development the human being has arrived could have been possible without the advancement in technology. The radical change and advancement in the economy, as we observe today, is the result of the modern technology.\n\nTechnology has brought about efficiency and quality in the manufacturing sector. Technological advancement has reduced the risk involved in manufacturing enterprises. There has been tremendous improvement in the field of health the world over not only the average age of people has increased but the mortality rate has also declined considerably.\n\nThis could be possible only because of technological advancement in health sector. There is perhaps no field of human life which has not been affected by technology. Agriculture, industry, profession, health, education, art, political processes, recreation, religious activities and daily life activities all are under the influence of technology.\n\nBut, it is important to keep in mind that technological advancement has affected human life both positively as Well as negatively. Not only that life has become easy and comfortable, there are also indications of several threats to life and society in the future due to use/misuse of modern technology.\n\nThe nature and extent of development the human society has experienced by now is heading towards crises in future. The sustainability of development is in question today. This has happened only due to irrational use of technology.\n\nIt has been discussed here as to how development – economic as well as social – takes place with the advancement of technology but not without leaving a scar to threaten the human society. The development of technology, which itself is symptomatic of development, has brought about not only economic development but also radical changes in the social and cultural spheres of society.\n\nThis articles also points out the negative effects of technological advancements on social, cultural and economic aspects of human life. Technological advancement and development have come to a stage where human society finds itself at a crossroads. The positive as well as negative roles of technology have put humans into to a situation of flux and confusion.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

But don't get that a person or you can celebrity life gets affected and it will make them feel irritated because once they get out from their house all their fans standing outside to see a person and get pictures with them. Now after this journalist comes they click their photos and put them between public. For example, a celebrity is travelling abroad for vacation with his/her family and a journalist will click a picture will write a celebrity is travelling abroad with his family and all the details about them. It should not be allowed to post or write all the details about a person it's his private life. But if a person from himself allowed to do that then it is different. \n\nOn the other hand, a job done by a journalist will give fame to a celebrity and make them grow even higher. Still, sometimes celebrity gets irritated because of their mood maybe by doing this/they may get defamed. The public will not like them and their carrier must be in trouble by doing this they will become their own enemy and can trouble in the future. it can lead to a person depression, anxiety, and many more. for example if one gets depressed and he commits suicide the fans of a particular will break and can take any step that can affect the community.  \n\nAs per my knowledge, people should not get in someone's personal life if it's a normal person or a celebrity it will make someone's life disturbing and journalists also should not post things until it's not between public.\n\nTo sum up, people should focus on their own lives and let others do their work so it will not affect their life and someone's other life also, or else it will affect the community and spread negativity.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""In recent years, the debate over whether individuals who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyle choices and poor diets should pay more for healthcare has garnered significant attention. On one hand, it can be argued that personal responsibility should be emphasized, as these individuals knowingly engage in behaviors that lead to health issues. On the other hand, healthcare is a basic human right, and treating illnesses should not be contingent upon personal choices. Striking a balance between these perspectives is crucial for an equitable healthcare system.\n\nEncouraging personal responsibility is essential in promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. By imposing higher healthcare costs for those who consistently engage in risky behaviors, society sends a message about the importance of self-care and prevention. It incentivizes individuals to take ownership of their health, leading to a reduction in preventable illnesses over time.\n\nHowever, this approach should not overlook the underlying factors that contribute to unhealthy choices. Socioeconomic status, access to education, and environmental factors can influence one's ability to make healthy decisions. Therefore, it is imperative to address the root causes of unhealthy behaviors rather than solely penalizing individuals.\n\n\nA more balanced approach involves a combination of personal responsibility and systemic support. Investing in education and awareness programs can empower individuals to make informed choices. Additionally, governments and healthcare institutions should collaborate to develop policies that promote healthy lifestyles and provide affordable access to nutritious foods and healthcare services.\n\nIn conclusion, while personal responsibility plays a role in health outcomes, singling out individuals who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and diets with higher healthcare costs may not be the most equitable solution. Instead, we should emphasize education, support, and systemic change to foster healthier communities. Striving for a society that values prevention and provides accessible healthcare for all will lead to better overall health and well-being.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""INTRODUCTION:\n              The relationship between personal lifestyle choices, such as unhealthy diets and behaviors, and healthcare costs has long been a subject of debate.\n Some argue that individuals who engage in unhealthy practices should bear a larger burden of healthcare costs, while others emphasize the importance of equitable access to medical care. This essay aims to explore the nuances of this topic and present a balanced perspective on whether people who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for healthcare.\n\n             *)Personal Responsibility and Autonomy:\nThe principle of personal responsibility advocates that individuals should be accountable for their actions and choices. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that if a person knowingly engages in behaviors that contribute to health issues, they should also be responsible for the resulting healthcare costs. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and encourages a sense of accountability in healthcare decisions.\n\n         *)Complex Determinants of Health:\nHowever, the link between lifestyle choices and health outcomes is not always straightforward. Health is influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetics, socioeconomic status, access to education, and environmental conditions. This complexity makes it difficult to attribute all health issues solely to personal choices, and it raises concerns about unfairly penalizing individuals for factors beyond their control.\n\n   *)Promoting Health and Prevention:\nInstead of focusing solely on punitive measures, a more constructive approach could involve investing in preventive measures and education. By promoting healthy behaviors and providing resources for individuals to make informed choices, societies can address the root causes of unhealthy lifestyles and potentially reduce the burden on the healthcare system in the long run.\n\n      *)Ethical Considerations:\nImposing higher healthcare costs on individuals with unhealthy lifestyles can lead to ethical dilemmas. It may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations with limited access to education, resources, or healthcare facilities. Penalizing individuals who are already facing challenges might exacerbate health disparities, which should be averted in a just and compassionate society.\n\n    *)Impact on Healthcare System:\nCharging higher fees to those with unhealthy lifestyles might discourage people from seeking medical attention, exacerbating health problems and leading to more significant healthcare costs in the long term. A preventative and inclusive healthcare approach could help in addressing health concerns early, ultimately reducing overall costs.\n\n   *)Balancing Personal Freedom and Public Costs:\nStriking a balance between personal freedom and public healthcare costs is a delicate task. While it's essential to encourage healthy behaviors, it's also crucial to ensure that everyone has access to necessary medical care without facing undue financial burdens. Finding innovative solutions that incentivize healthier choices while upholding the principles of equity and compassion is key.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether people who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for healthcare is a complex and multifaceted issue. While personal responsibility is important, it is equally crucial to recognize the broader determinants of health and to approach healthcare costs with sensitivity to equity and social justice. A comprehensive approach that focuses on prevention, education, and support may be more effective in promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing healthcare costs in the long term.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

Hardly a healthy role model: Homer is seen replacing his usual popcorn with a healthier snack and encouraging his family to do the same. One thing the Simpsons do enjoy is family meals around the dining table – another aspect of family life which is dying out and being replaced by TV dinners.

They believe that individuals should be accountable for their choices and the impact they have on their health. By making people pay more for their healthcare, it may incentivize them to adopt healthier habits, reducing the burden on the healthcare system caused by preventable illnesses. Moreover, many people argue that it is unfair for individuals who lead healthier lifestyles to shoulder the same financial burden as those who engage in risky behaviors or poor eating habits. Charging more for health care based on lifestyle choices is seen as a way to distribute the costs more equitably. the issue of charging more for health care to individuals with unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets is a controversial one. While holding individuals accountable for their choices is essential, we must also consider the broader factors that influence health outcomes. Striking a balance between personal responsibility and equitable access to healthcare is crucial. Encouraging preventive care, public health education, and positive reinforcement for healthier choices may be more effective in promoting overall well-being without unfairly burdening specific groups of people. Ultimately, a holistic approach that empowers individuals to make healthier choices while addressing systemic issues is essential in ensuring the well-being of society as a whole.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""introduction:\n\nIn modern society, the issue of healthcare costs has become increasingly challenging to manage. One controversial topic revolves around whether individuals who contribute to their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should shoulder a greater financial burden for their healthcare. Advocates of differentiated pricing argue that this approach promotes personal responsibility and helps offset the costs incurred by preventable diseases. However, opponents criticize it for potentially penalizing vulnerable populations. This essay explores the rationale behind differentiated pricing and its implications for the healthcare system.\n\nBody:\n\nEncouraging Personal Responsibility:\nDifferentiated pricing proposes that individuals who make lifestyle choices leading to their illnesses bear additional costs in healthcare. This principle promotes personal responsibility, as it holds individuals accountable for the consequences of their decisions. Encouraging healthier lifestyle choices can contribute to reduced healthcare costs in the long run.\n\nFair Allocation of Resources:\nBy implementing differentiated pricing, the healthcare system can allocate resources more fairly. When individuals knowingly engage in unhealthy behaviors, they may impose higher healthcare expenses on themselves and society. By having them contribute more to their care, resources can be better distributed to support those who require medical assistance due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nReducing the Burden on the Healthcare System:\nThe strain on healthcare systems due to preventable diseases can be significant. If unhealthy lifestyle choices are a major contributing factor to a substantial number of health issues, differentiated pricing could alleviate some pressure by encouraging individuals to adopt healthier habits. This, in turn, may reduce the overall demand for healthcare services.\n\nPotential for Inequality:\nOpponents argue that differentiated pricing could exacerbate existing inequalities. Vulnerable populations, such as those with limited access to education or resources, may face higher healthcare costs due to circumstances beyond their control. The system must carefully consider these concerns to avoid worsening social disparities.\n\nBalancing Personal Freedom and Public Health:\nWhile promoting personal responsibility is crucial, it is essential to strike a balance between individual freedom and public health. Policies should focus on education, preventive care, and supporting healthier lifestyles rather than solely relying on punitive measures.\n\nAddressing Root Causes:\nDifferentiated pricing can be a contentious solution to address preventable illnesses. To tackle this issue more effectively, society should invest in comprehensive public health campaigns, affordable access to nutritious food, and opportunities for physical activity. Addressing the root causes of unhealthy behaviors can lead to sustainable change.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDifferentiated pricing in healthcare remains a divisive topic with valid arguments on both sides. Encouraging personal responsibility is essential, but it must be approached with sensitivity to avoid disproportionately burdening vulnerable populations. Striking a balance between individual choice and societal well-being is crucial, and focusing on preventive measures could prove more effective in the long term. By working together to promote healthier lifestyles and investing in accessible resources, we can foster a healthier population and a more sustainable healthcare system for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""One way to reduce the cost of healthcare would be to make people who engage in these unhealthy behaviors pay more for their care. This would create an incentive for people to change their lifestyles and improve their health. It would also help to ensure that those who are most responsible for the cost of healthcare are the ones who bear the brunt of it.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also some arguments against making people who cause their own illnesses pay more for healthcare. One concern is that this could lead to discrimination against people who are already sick. It could also discourage people from seeking preventive care, which could ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs in the long run.\n\nAnother concern is that it is not always easy to determine who is responsible for their own illness. For example, someone who is obese may have a genetic predisposition to obesity, or they may have developed obesity due to factors beyond their control, such as poverty or food insecurity. In these cases, it would be unfair to make them pay more for their healthcare.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether people who cause their own illnesses should pay more for healthcare is a difficult one to answer. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement such a policy would need to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the relevant factors.\n\nIn my opinion, a more equitable approach would be to focus on prevention. We need to do more to educate people about the risks of unhealthy lifestyles and to provide them with the resources they need to make healthy choices. We also need to make sure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare, regardless of their lifestyle choices.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

A healthy diet helps children grow and develop properly and reduces their risk of chronic diseases.

Healthy eating can help people with chronic diseases manage these conditions and avoid complications.\n\nHowever, when healthy options are not available, people may settle for foods that are higher in calories and lower in nutritional value. People in low-income communities and some racial and ethnic groups often lack access to convenient places that offer affordable, healthier foods.\n\nMost people in the United States don’t eat a healthy diet and consume too much sodium, saturated fat, and sugar, increasing their risk of chronic diseases.

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""People who eat too much junk food suffer from many serious side effects and health problems, including weight gain, tooth decay, diabetes and heart disease, SFGate explains. A large part of the problem stems from the excessive amounts of fat and sodium typically found in this type of food.Junk food is bad because it typically has a high caloric content that consists of fat and sugar packed into small portions, according to WebMD. Additionally, junk food is formulated to taste very appealing to the senses, making it difficult to stop eating or addictive. Popular junk foods include potato chips, candy bars, cookies, soda, snack cakes and most fast food.Right nutrition is now by your side. 2 glasses of PediaSure everyday for complete growth. PediaSure has Arginine and Vitamin K2. It helps your child's bones grow long and strong. Brain Development. Growth Nutrients. Immunity Booster. Gain Weight & Height.Weight gain is one of the side effects that comes from eating too much junk food, SFGate states. This occurs because fast food tends to contain many calories and a high fat content. Sweet treats and drinks also often contain excess calories because of their sugar content. These excess calories cause people to gain weight, contributing to obesity.\nSFGate points out that junk food also contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The high fat content of this food clogs the arteries, increasing the risk of strokes and heart attacks. The high amount of sodium in some junk food raises blood pressure, making it more difficult for blood to flow.\nTooth decay is yet another problem associated with junk food, SFGate says. The sugar in sodas and other sweet beverages allows bacteria to produce acid that ruins teeth enamel.\nSFGate advises consumers to pick the healthiest fast foods, avoid fatty fries and other deep-fried food, and eat less.""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

This essay will discuss why improper lifestyle and poor food choices made result in a higher health care bill.\r\n\r\nDevelopment in technology has led to packaged foods being over processed, this, in turn, reduces the nutritional value of a food item which when consumed in excessive amounts may lead to health issues.

First and foremost is that equality in the community. Medical services are never iniquitous to a person’s meal charts and lifestyle, and it is the same for all. If doctors charge more from them, then there are a high chance that it will forge a society into two parts, healthy and unhealthy people. Additionally, it will affect the psyche of the person. Secondly, it will be a burden for the middle class and penurious people who have health issues. Moreover, there are other various options to overcome this problem. Finally, as people are paying various taxes to the bureaucrats, it is their responsibility to yield affordable medical services to the citizen.\n\nHowever, rising health-check up charges from those who have unhealthy diets would motivate others to shift toward protean and nutritious contained food. Furthermore, there are various alternatives way to keep people healthier.\n\n\n""",CONTENT: Inclusion and elaboration of ideas and sense of audience and purpose.,ORGANISATION: Coherence and cohesion,GRAMMAR: Use of syntactic patterns and grammatical accuracy,VOCABULARY: Range and appropriateness,SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION,,4,,4,,5,,5,,2,20,

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care.","""A vast majority of people around the world don't pay enough attention to their nutrition and lifestyle. And, of course, it often leads to unwanted consequences as different health problems that need to be solved. There are contradictory opinions regarding funding source of healthcare. As for me, I strongly believe that every person should be financial responsible for illnesses which are the result of inappropriate behaviour. \n\nFirst of all, it motivates both men and women to exclude as more bad habits as they can to save their money. It is absolutely obvious that citizens who don't worry about their own condition and needs of the organism should pay additional charge for medical insurance. For example, in some countries medical companies require patients to notify if they have particular bad habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, lack of exercise and others. And the more they have the more they force to pay. Thus, it would decrease person's desire to buy harmful products or to smoke and make them to be more physically active. \n\nSecondly, it would save state resources for treating individuals with heavy deceases which were not caused by their activities. The main task of government is to provide community of basic healthcare and make it accessible to everyone. As we know, the advanced medical and surgical treatments are very expensive. For instance, sometimes we need to raise money for seriously ill people, because federal or local budgets lack to allocate funds for that purpose. Accordingly, if authorities stop spending savings for individuals which sicknesses are their own faults, it will be sufficient resources for those who don’t provoke any deceases and suffer without therapy support.
