"WHO defines health as Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Illness is commonly defined as absence of good health in a person.\n\nIll-health of a person can have many causes and consequences. Illness is not always physical but may be mental, social or psychological. A person, who is ill, lacks the experience of soundness in his body, mind as well as spirit. Once illness sets in a person, he is deprived of the happiness and the joys in the outside world that he seeks otherwise in state of wellness.\n\nSenior and Viveash (1998) have defined six stages of illness. Social conditions like poverty, inadequate nutrition, inappropriate housing, rising pollution and unhygienic and unsafe play areas for children fall into the first stage of illness"
