"Its not fair anyone pay more because they lifestyle or diets are poor about vitamins or unhealthy things.\nSome people dont have access a good food, good opportunities in their lifes to be a healthy person, or even a health care.\nI believe everybody need more opportunities to be healthy, to have access a good food, and instructions about the lifestyle, healthy and illness, because when they have information they can understand why they need to eat and care about their lifes, not just try to put more strict rules because they are unhealthy.\nOn other hand, if the people have good access to information, food, and ways to have a godo lifestyle, they can have more strict rules, maybe something like, not allowed to do some kind of public jobs, or maybe cant go to army."
