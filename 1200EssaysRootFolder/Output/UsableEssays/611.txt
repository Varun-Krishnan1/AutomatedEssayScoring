"     Individual can do something to change society. The way we evaluate and received information regarding an environment makes us different since it leads to various decisions being made. Environmental behaviours also make us different every aspect depends on an individual's take. Decision making cannot be based on just an individual since judging from one perception may not represent the the entire group or population. The personal difference are attributed to the behavioral styles that influence the way persons are forced to change their lifestyles. One may have a positive view over something while another may perceive the same issue in a negative manner hence making the two different in opinions. But I truly believe that if all individual work as a team everything will work well eventually.\n      Historically a large number of changes and developments have been brought by governments and big organizations. Their actions have led that many people believe that individuals are incapable to become an agents who can change the society. I do not agree with it completely.\n"
