"Making substantial changes in society has always been a major concern for every nation. It is believed that these changes can be made only by the government, whereas others argue that an individual can make a difference and eventually change the society. In my opinion, the influences from the former are by far more significant than that from the individuals owing to financial consideration and their authorities.\n\nIn order to initiate changes in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With strong financial foundations, governments can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific research and paying for the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development. Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, the government Awards study grants and scholarships for deserving pupils This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils.\n\nSecondly, The social influences from governments and large corporations also bring changes on a larger scale. By improving regulations and laws, governments can affect the public behaviors on a national level through civil obligation. Large corporations can influence societies too by being a leading role in their industries.This way individuals are also accountable to the responsibilities towards the betterment of a society. Furthermore, governments are shaped by individuals. As a result, both individuals and governments should accompany each other in order to prepare healthier community conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undoubtedly that individuals participation is crucial to social changes. However, governments and large institutions have greater potential in provoking changes more significantly and effectively with the help of their financial support and authorities.\n\n"
