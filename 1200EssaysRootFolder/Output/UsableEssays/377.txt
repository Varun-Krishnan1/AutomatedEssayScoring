"I empathise with Moya Lothian-Mclean's article on withdrawing from social media. I also tended to  post, but Covid has taught me that of my 360-odd Facebook \"friends\" , only a select few have bothered to checkup on me during the past two difficult years, when I was alone for much of the time. Real friends are the ones who are there for you in hard times, and do things like drop by with a bunch of flowers, offer to do  a bit shopping, or ring up for a chat."
