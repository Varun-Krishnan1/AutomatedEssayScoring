"We are living in an era where people are more social in the internet or in the social media than in their normal lives. People of the Gen Y and Gen Z are becoming more and more addicted to social media that they are gradually forgetting their real existence and getting detached with the outer world.\n\n The people of this generation is making friends on social media more than the physical world. This increasing use of social media is making this generation really unsocial. Though all impact of social media are not negative, still it is not a substitute of the physical world. Now a days people are making friends online. They are spending time by talking over the phone or chatting through the social media. They are so busy with their online world that they are forgetting their childhood friends. But they are not realizing that their childhood friends are those who will stay by their side in time of difficulties. It may look cool to have thousands of online friends in social media, but at the end of the day we need the ones who can be there for us in time of difficulties. \n\nAnother problem with this social media friendship  We can not recognize someone as long as we send enough time with them, and here this is the problem with this virtual world. Here nobody knows each other, we can only get to know someone only what they want us to know. Nobody will come to help us in the time of difficulties. That is why it is cool to make thousands of social media friends, but we all need some friends to stay with us out of this virtual world, whom we know very well, whom we can trust blindly, the one who will stay beside us in every ups and downs. An online friendship is no substitute of a real friendship. It may increase our popularity, but can never decrease the need of a real genuine friend."
