"It is argued that personal lives of political leaders should not be made public by media. This essay totally agrees with the above statement because everyone has the right to privacy, irrespective of their profession; moreover, publishing these kinds of news can end the career of potential candidates. \njust like a common man, politicians also have the right to protect their personal life, and media should not intrude into it. Nowadays, many magazines and newspapers are seen printing the bedroom stories of famous leaders and officeholders for more sale, which should be stopped. What they are doing inside their homes or in their private space is nobodys business, and publishers must respect it. For example, many countries like India have the provision, which prohibits news agencies and other paparazzi from writing anything that gives a sneak peak in their personal matter.\nTo conclude, private lives of politicians are important, which are not for making columns in magazines and newspapers. Their rights must be respected by not publishing anything related to their personal stuff that can even damage their profession. Therefore, news portals must restrain from writing and advertising such things.\n"
