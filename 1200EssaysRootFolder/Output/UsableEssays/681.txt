"According to some, in today's fast-paced and competitive world, children are experiencing more societal pressure compared to previous generations. I tend to agree with the opinion that today's children are living under greater societal pressure. By analyzing the increased academic expectations and the influence of social media, it becomes evident that the pressures faced by children today are indeed more pronounced.\nOne compelling reason why I believe that children face greater societal pressure today is the heightened academic expectations. In the past, academic success was important, but it was not as intensely emphasized as it is now. With the increasing emphasis on standardized testing, college admissions, and academic achievements, children today are constantly under pressure to excel academically. For instance, the competition for university placements has intensified, leading to a heightened focus on academic performance from an early age.\nAnother significant factor, in my opinion, contributing to increased societal pressure on children is the pervasive influence of social media. Unlike in the past, children today are exposed to a virtual world that puts them under constant scrutiny and comparison. Social media platforms highlight carefully curated images of success, beauty, and popularity, creating unrealistic standards that children feel compelled to meet. \nIn conclusion, the notion that today's children face more societal pressure than children in the past holds true. The increased academic expectations and the influence of social media contribute to a heightened sense of pressure and scrutiny. Parents, educators, and society as a whole need to recognize and address these pressures to ensure the well-being and healthy development of children.\n\n"
