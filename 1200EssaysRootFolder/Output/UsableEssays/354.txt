"It's strange to have a friend that you have never hugged, shook their hand or looked into their eyes.\nBut you have been touched by their soul, seen the good in their hearts and felt the warmth of their being.\nWords of Wwww.Facebook\nThe friends I have never met are not my friends untouched, for I have felt them with me when I needed them. I have confided in them and they are some of the kindest people I have ever known.\nMy Friends, never forget just how special you are to me.\n"
