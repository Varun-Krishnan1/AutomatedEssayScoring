As came to resources, the products which has been used so healthy in every sector. In every aspects, the life which was lived is so good and quality which respective to ethics.\nAs years was passed, human being was spending most of the time on earning money. By involving in that process, human being losing their ethics and human valves. Human beings were becoming so greed and selfish. they are emphasis to earning money. because of that, so many sectors changing their pattern like changing the products quality because of their benefits. due to this, so many were facing problems. these all things was happend due to giving more valve to earning money. earning of money also important for humans, but it should be done by following some ethical valves then no one will be get effected. every activities of this human life was effecting in different sectors in different aspects. due to this quality of life was effecting so much , it should be reduce by learning some ethical and moral valves. so I agreed with both the quarries that emphasis to earning money is good but it should not effect the quality of life."
