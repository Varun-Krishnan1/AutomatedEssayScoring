"In my opinion I think it's right, I agree that by the time, we have been placed with the idea of working hard for success but when we start working you start noticing that you are becoming like your parents, in a bad way you are spending the most precious gift of life that is the time for money something that yes we need it for living but sometimes we don't have a balance in our life's and we start to live for working in spite of work for living well, so I think people should get a balance on everything and if you win good amount of money the best way to get this is just enjoy for what you have worked for."
