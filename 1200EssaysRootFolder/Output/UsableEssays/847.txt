"Encouraging children to do part time job during their leisure time is becoming nowadays. Even though it helps to develop the habit of hardworking and confidence in children, it has some drawbacks as well.\n\nFirstly, part time jobs will help the children to understand and experience the      difficulties and hardships parents face during their everyday day life to raise them.      This will surely enable them to appreciate the hard work of their parents and children will try to          share some of the responsibilities. They will understand the need for sharing and      caring. Working in a team will help children understand the             importance of interdependence and accepting the peers. A part time job also gives them a taste of their future life and will help them to organise their life in a disciplined manner and teach them how to balance personal life and work\n\nOn the other hand, non availability of free time will affect the mental and physical            development of children. They will be forced to go to work after school hours and the         valuable time they get to play and remould their fine motor skills will be reduced. The chance to earn money at a young age will also result in social and moral issues among          children. Since they dont know how to manage the financial matters, they will utilize it for anti social activities such as smoking, alcohol consumption. The part time job will      also reduce their opportunities to interact with their peers of same age.\n\nIn conclusion, even though a part time job is beneficial for nurturing in children qualities like             interdependence, self confidence and courage to face real life situations, it may affect the mental and physical development of children. The knowledge and enthusiasm they get while reading stories and interacting with peers should not be compromised for other things."
