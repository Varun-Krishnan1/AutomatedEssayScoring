"i don't agree that older people are said to be much better leaders, even they are experienced and seen lot of up and downs, younger people way of thinking is different. firstly the young generation will lose the influence to join sections where mostly old people are preferred.youth leaders are active and healthy .if an old person assigned as team leader at a technology development sector and that person has expertise in technological items that were widely used previously but now it is not the same picture then it will be a problem for that person to cope with the situation and create correct development for a new generation. \non the other hand ,if young people are introduced as team leaders in certain sectors they will perform better responsibilities than older people .because of their age they have more energy to put into work for the better success of an industry .\nTo conclude , older people are said to more experienced but in  certain sectors, experience is not required as much as energy and expertise. and to better serve the society encouraging the young generation is very important.
