"In the words of Warren Buffet 'if you don't make money while you sleep, you will work until you die'. We live in a society where we are brought up to leave school or university and get a high paying job. This leads people to focus very heavily on finding the best paying jobs in their industry and work hard to keep that pay cheque coming in every month, then work even harder to gain a small pay rise or promotion. This is a traditional way of that had been perceived as becoming successful in life. However, this philosophy has some fundamental problems with it."
