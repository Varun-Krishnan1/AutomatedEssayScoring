"Of course, not all older people are wise, compassionate, patient, forgiving, or grateful. But in general, older people do tend to have these qualities to a greater extent than younger people. This is why the saying that older people are much better people is not entirely off base.\n\nOf course, there are also some negative stereotypes about older people. Some people believe that they are set in their ways, that they are no longer productive, or that they are a burden on society. These stereotypes are unfair and untrue. Older people can be just as creative, productive, and independent as younger people. They can also make valuable contributions to society.\n\nIt is important to remember that everyone is an individual, and we should not judge people based on their age. Older people are just as diverse as any other population group. There are good and bad people of all ages. But in general, older people do tend to have the qualities that we associate with being a good person. They are wiser, more compassionate, more patient, and more grateful. These qualities make them an asset to society, and we should all do our part to appreciate and respect them."
