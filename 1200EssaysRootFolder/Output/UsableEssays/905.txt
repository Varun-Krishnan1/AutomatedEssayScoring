"the work is very important in our life because of the reasons. First, when you work, you develop new skills, learn new things, and create a record of employment. Second, when you have a job or a career, you have self-respect, dignity and self-esteem. Finally, through work, we produce material values which we own and which we can use according to our aspirations."
