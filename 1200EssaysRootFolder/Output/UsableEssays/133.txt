"There is a common belief that older people make better leaders. This perception is often based on the assumption that older individuals possess more experience, wisdom, and maturity. However, leadership skills are not solely determined by age. Effective leadership can be found in individuals of all ages, as it depends on a combination of qualities such as communication, decision-making, adaptability, and emotional intelligence. Therefore, it is important to evaluate leadership potential based on individual capabilities rather than age alone."
