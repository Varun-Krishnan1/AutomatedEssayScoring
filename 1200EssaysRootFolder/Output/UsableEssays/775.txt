"some people feel that young people face more pressure today than then the equivalent age group did in previous generation. Others think they have a much easier life than  their parents did. \n             it is a well known fact that young people are the most precious experience more pressure and difficulties today today than in the past. Contrary to the above belief others think that young age generation has much easier life than their parents had. in my opinion, life of young people today is not as easy in  the past. They are inundated with a number of socioeconomic issues and responsibilities today. \n               One of the major problem faced by youth today is unemployment. Unlike in the past, when the academic success was always an open sesame to well paid job, nowadays young people need to make an enormous effort to find jobs which are suitable for their educational background. this tendency can be attributed to intense competition increased population and many other socio-economic change that took place over the past few decades."
