"A study has found that young adults are now facing more pressure from their parents that past generations have. As parents, we try and do everything we can to support our child, but we know that we also may have to give them small pushes in the right direction. We know, deep down, that it is for their benefit. Definitely the youth today faces much more pressure than the previous generation. They have to adapt to several circumstances at once. This kind of pressure has made the world much more dynamic and fast-paced."
