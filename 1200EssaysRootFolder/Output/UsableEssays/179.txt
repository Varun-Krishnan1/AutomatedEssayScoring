"Personally, I do not agree with the topic. I think that the idea that suggest an economic growth with the cost of damaged natural environment comes from the conventional view of profitable industries of mass energy consumption and heavy pollution. This used to be a common practice at the era of the Industrial Revolution, during which there are limited forms of industry and little attention to a natural and untouched environment. People are too greedy and short-sighted to notice the price of such development at the time. When the development of a coutry is based on such industries, the previous idea may make sense to some extent. However, this is not always the case as there are other ways of development that are enviromentally-friendly. For example, high-technology industries that products precision instruments gain far more profits while requiring little materials compared to basic ones such as steel industries. When a country has the right to choose among its development methods, it will definitely boost the ecomomic fields of better environmental outputs. Only if a country is poor in its industral and technological basis and has no solution to that will it sacrefice the natural environment for economic growth. This does exists in certain countries at specific historical periods, but many countries have proved it wrong by their construction achievements. Among them are Sigapore which makes full use of its position as an international harbour, Israel which relies on its military industries, etc.. In short, the world has witnessed many countries that have broken the \"law\" by their on thoughts and efforts on economic development."
