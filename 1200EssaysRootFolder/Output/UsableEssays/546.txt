"Actually If Individuals can do something to change Society but it doesn't make bigger impact on society So we need an Governments and Large Institutions to take initiate to make better changes in the Environment\nSociety is one of the most important aspect of a healthy and peaceful life which is getting degraded with this growing world. Some people believe that new developments can only be incorporated in the society by the governments and that individuals cannot give any contribution towards the change.In my opinion individuals play a vital role in the change of society and this essay will discuss what can an individual do for the change.To conclude, the government and people should work hand in hand to bring about change in society. It is difficult for individuals to work alone towards the goal, but even the government's efforts may go in vain if the citizens are not cooperative."
