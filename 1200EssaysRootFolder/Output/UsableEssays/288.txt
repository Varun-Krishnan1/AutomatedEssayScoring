"I do think money earns too more attention by people than quality of life. Making money is just a way of achieving a high-quality life, but it seems that the instrument is taking place of the goal.\nHuman can hardly overcome the desire, which is crazy and endless. The most common words we hear a lot in daily life is \"I will be happy when I become rich\", but how rich is \"rich\"? People keep making more and more money and still do not feel rich enough. The consequence is the harder they work, the less happy they are.\nIt is true that everything comes with a price. We have to make choices in many circumstances. The things we give up are often ones that are invaluable. We spend more time working for money and therefore ignore many other important things in life. Examples can include relationships with others, our hobbies, and so on, which are all essential parts of a good living quality.\nI am not challenging the foundational role of material life, and I am just saying that it is not the only thing deserves efforts. Only if we strike a balance between money and life, can we make a life that is not only fruitful but also meaningful.\n"
