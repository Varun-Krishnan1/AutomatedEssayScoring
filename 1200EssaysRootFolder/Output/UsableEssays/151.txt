"I agree with this opinion because older people have more experienced so they can get through any situation well. If any problem have, older leader will be able to solve with it wisely. For example you're watching the movie 'The Intern'. When a young CEO is embarrassed because he has little experience, then an older intern suggests a solution.\nWhen a company has a big problem and needs to be held accountable, the leader must be able to take responsibility."
