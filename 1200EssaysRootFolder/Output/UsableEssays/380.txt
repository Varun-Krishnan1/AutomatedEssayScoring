"Online friends are good friends whom we meet online through social media and through many platforms. But real friends are no lesser than online friends because whenever we are in need sometimes online friends don't help but real friends may help you. Having online friends isn't bad as long as you go about it safely. If you're wondering what makes online friends real, it is partially the social emotional connection you have and partially verifying that they are who they say they are. A real life friend will make you feel good even when you're feeling depressed about the job market or going through a difficult period in your life. An online friend can console you, but just doesn't have the same context ."
