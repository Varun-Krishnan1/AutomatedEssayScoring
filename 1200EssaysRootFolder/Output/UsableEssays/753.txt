"It is a well known fact that young people are the most precious asset of any country. Some people believe that young generation experience more pressure and difficulties today than in the past. Contrary to the above belief, others think that the young generation has much easier life than their parents had. In my opinion, life of young people today is not as easy as in the past. They are inundated with a number of socio-economic issues and responsibilities today.\n\nOne of the major problems faced by youth today is unemployment. Unlike in the past, when the academic success was always an open sesame to well-paid job, nowadays young people need to make an enormous effort to find jobs which are suitable for their educational background. This tendency can be attributed to intense competition, increased population and many other socio-economic changes that took place over the past few decades.\n\n\nAnother social trend that has led to increase pressure among young people is a substantial growth in elderly population. In fact, it has become a huge burden on youth to provide food, healthcare and other basic facilities for ever-growing elderly population. Consequently, they need earn a grate deal of money to fulfill these huge responsibilities. Therefore, the level of stress experienced by young people is comparatively high.\n\n\nMoreover, young people need to cope up with many new issues and challenges. Disruption of environmental balance at an alarming rate, drastic changes in weather, civil wars and emerging of new diseases are few issues which invariably create more pressures among young people. The quality of life of youth has also affected by the increased prevalence of crime rate and corruptions."
