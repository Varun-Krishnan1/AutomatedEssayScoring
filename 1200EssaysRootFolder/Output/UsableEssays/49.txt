"Many people believe that young people should lead companies instead of the older ones. Personally, I completely disagree with this statement because those aged staffs with experiences can bring more advantages for a group.\n\nIt is obvious that experienced people have expert power - which can hardly be found in a young leader, to give right directions to their subordinates in work. As a result, an efficient working routine with controllable outcomes will be set up, making a better reputation for company. Furthermore, when an unexpected problem happens, an aged senior staff will be more quickly to find a feasible solution than the younger one since their problem-solving skill has been developed through years. For example, when facing an on-site issue in construction industry, a 20 years experience architect can sit at the office and tell the workers exactly what they can do. Meanwhile, it will take a lot of time for a 5 years leader to find the same solution. "
