"In the past few decades, mankind put more weight on health care. These days, a number of people have poor diets and unhealthy lifestyles; as a result, they are suffering from the deleterious disease. Many people believe that they have to pay extra for health care.

First and foremost is that equality in the community. Medical services are never iniquitous to a persons meal charts and lifestyle, and it is the same for all.

Secondly, it will be a burden for the middle class and penurious people who have health issues. Moreover, there are other various options to overcome this problem. Finally, as people are paying various taxes to the bureaucrats, it is their responsibility to yield affordable medical services to the citizen.\n\nHowever, rising health-check up charges from those who have unhealthy diets would motivate others to shift toward protean and nutritious contained food. Furthermore, there are various alternatives way to keep people healthier.\n\n\n"
