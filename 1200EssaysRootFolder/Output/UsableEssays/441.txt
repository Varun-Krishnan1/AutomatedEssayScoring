"Face-to-face friendships are most frequently built on proximity, shared activities, or life events. Online friendships are similar in that they usually develop around the same three factors and in a way that's even more intense that it might be in real life. We connect with strangers online who show up in groups that center around interests and activities. Just to name a few, these include new mothers; the newly divorced; military spouses; graduate students in particular programs; weight loss forums; self-help groups for substance abusers; yoga practitioners; or support groups for individuals who suffer from a particular illness. We will be drawn to particular individuals whose stories are similar to our own or whose experience intrigue us. In effect, the shared activities and life events are the point at which our lives first intersect with potential virtual friends; the proximity is often a non-issue, as these friends are as close as our computer or our cellphone! We carry our \"support group\" in our pockets and our shared interest bonds us even closer. We can obsess about our issues and those of our virtual friends -- more than our \"face-to-face friends\" probably would ever have the patience to allow us to do."
