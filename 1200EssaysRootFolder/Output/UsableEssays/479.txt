"Online friendship is no substitute for real friends, i struggling agree with the statement bcoz on real friendship is one who is around us understands the inner emotions and feelings of each one ..in addition they was clearly understand about  action and reaction  ,when we are happy r sad ..or feeling empty .Each movement of our actions are margied with our real friends were in  substitute friendship only our words speaks not the emotions and feelings therefore , one real friends is  more than enough than the  substitute friendship. Where as everyone one needs friend one or the another not to share  bad times but also we need them to share our inner happiness which we can fully enjoy.so be the one real friend to someone instead of being a substitute friend."
