"In general, young people today do face severer stress than in previous generations.\nFirstly, it is obvious that the economic inequality has been more serious than before. The top 1% richest people dominate more than 70% of the global wealth, which would be definitely beyond imagination 50 years ago. Secondly, the employment opportunities have been decreasing for nearly 3 years, while the number of university graduates has been increasing at the same time. In other words, the competition in labour market has been increasingly fierce and it will be more and more difficult for young people to find a job in near future. Thirdly, the cost for forming a family is rising as well, including the price of real estate, the expense on education, the cost of medical care. Under such circumstances, more young people will tend to keep single and refuse marriage, leading to more bankrupt of companies in related industries, which will bring about fewer job opportunities and lower income. In comparison, the phonomena above did not exist decades ago, when young people in those generations were less stressful.\nNonetheless, young people today do have the chance to enjoy more advanced electronic equipment, more delicious food, more convenient transportation and so on. 50 years ago, no one at that time could have, or even imagine, the personal computer, laptop, cell phones and video games.\nTherefore, in summary, young people today are facing more stress than before, though they can enjoy modern life that never existed before."
