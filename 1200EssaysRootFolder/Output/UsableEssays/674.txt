"\nSome people feel that young people face more pressure today than the equivalent age groups did in previous generations. \n\n\nObviously, various generations have own problems and difficulties. According to some peoples beliefs young adults of nowadays encounter more stress than equivalent age people did in the past. However, some people think that they have a much easier life than previous generation did. In this essay I will discuss both sides and present my view. \n\nGenerally, 30 years ago, the older generation, would have never imagine the impact of the internet in our lives. Fortunately, we can have all the information that we need with the help of the internet. Advanced technology has made life more comfortable by providing the best medical treatments, free education, communication solutions, thousands of gadgets to simplify our daily tasks. For instance, students in the late 80's had not any educational resources except books from schools, but nowadays people gain more opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, reaching greater achievements requires greater obstackles, which means people can only expect more pressure to get things done, to be efficient, to improve what they have already achieved. Youngsters feel the demand to be better in every aspect of their lives. Since they have now more access, they are very informed and tend to make desicions by themselves. This ambitions lead to a highly competition between them. A good examples are various competitions at school, which are demand more informations from huge sources and ability. \n\nIn conclution, I think people should not ignore the problems of equivalent aged people in the past and todays generations. Different people face with various difficulties, which require more patience and strength.\n\nThank You."
