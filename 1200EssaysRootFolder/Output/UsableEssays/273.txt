"I think it comes down to personal priorities. I can only speak from the position of musician but allot of musicians trade income for doing for they love. Realistically they could make more money doing something else but they can't imagine doing anything else with their lives. For some people making money by doing something they don't like is fine. some people get to make a lot of money by doing what they enjoy. It's just that I watch my grandfather almost work himself to death while working for the federal government. He had to retire early because of the toll and good and he could afford to buy things for his family so to him it was it so I think a lot of people do focus to much on money but I understand the reasons"
