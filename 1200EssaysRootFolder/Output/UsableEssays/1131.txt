"First of all, i agree that today's people are very much affected by the journalists who are present too much private lives of famous people. According to me the journalists should be careful before presenting  the stories or current interests of famous people's private lives. Because it leaves a great impact on the society & social media. If the stories are good & has moral values in it then it can be present in the public for an inspiration or motivation to the viewers. But , if the story has vulgarity & immoral act then the journalist should think wisely before presenting in the newspapers. Stories can provoke the viewers in a negative manner & motivate the people to follow the negative action of the famous people. \nNewspapers should be allowed to publish details of peoples private lives unless it is clearly in the public interest , Because journalist should bring the truth & real picture of the famous peoples . \n"
