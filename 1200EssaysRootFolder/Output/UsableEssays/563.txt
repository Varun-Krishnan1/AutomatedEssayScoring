"Its hardly difficult for an individual to change the society all alone. Firstly all of us  must take initiative to change like they should be disciplined knowing their exact responsibility ,They should know exactly where to throw the waste ,Plantation of trees is much more required to fight against \"Global Warming\" Education will help to fight against illiteracy ,once people are educated it can help\nin the development of the society .we need to restrict the usage of water for our future generation .All those above mentioned work is not possible for a single individual to change. The entire society ,must come forward with there responsibility for better future . we all together can give a wonderful future to our next generation by simply taking initiatives to change.\n\nI would not say it very difficult for a individual to change the society all alone .If we can be a good Leader having the quality to spread literacy ,discipline ,behavior and have the zeal to change the thoughts first u need to motivate others .In that case your activities shall provoke others to change there lifestyle. we have seen around there are lot of Famous people around us and there contribution in this society is also appreciable .We need to adopt the qualities among us to attract the society and persuade them to follow all the good qualities in order to change the entire society."
