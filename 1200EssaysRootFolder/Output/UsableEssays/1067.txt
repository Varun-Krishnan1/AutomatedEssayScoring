"One of the areas where technology has made the biggest impact is in the realm of communication. Conversing with people outside of your immediate vicinity was once a difficult process, requiring physical letters and a lot of patience. For most of the last century, professional communication involved letter writing, faxing, or spending hours on the telephone. No longer. Email is now the primary mode of business communication in todays workplace."
