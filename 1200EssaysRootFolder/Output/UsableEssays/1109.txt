The optional third sentence may pose a question that the thesis aims to answer, or it may prompt the reader to think about the topic in a different light. The final sentence of the intro paragraph clearly establishes the thesis.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the introduction should go from broad to specific, sentence by sentence, gradually leading up to your thesis. Heres a sample example of an introductory paragraph.\n\n"
