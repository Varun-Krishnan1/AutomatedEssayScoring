"Nowdays,young people have more pressure than previous generations because of the changes that took place within the gap. Things became more easier now than before,now people are having motorcycles and vehicles but back then vehicles and motorcycles did not matter much people preferred walking. They had to do each and every thing by themselves whether its working or anykind of work but this young generation have got more facilities than before they have got cell phones which makes them more easier to work  rather than waiting in the lines and lines for their turn.\n                 Before there were games of many different kinds that were played by hands or legs such as cricket,football,batminton,marbles,seven stone and many more but now young generations people just need mobile to play games and spend their time which cause physical fitness that means no efforts of\n playing physical. It is a severe matter that this generation is facing more simplicity than before which will effect their future.\n       This thing will continue slowly and  silently people will start having effect in eyes, their bodies because of simplicity in life.People should take this matter seriously that their kids should have more physical fitness rather than having cell phone and wasting their time in their cell phones playing games       and havinf no interest in studying and making the future bright.
