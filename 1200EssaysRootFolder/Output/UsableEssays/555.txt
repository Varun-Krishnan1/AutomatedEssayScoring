"while it is true that governments and large institutions have considerable influence over societal changes, it would be a disservice to underestimate the power of individuals in shaping the course of society. History has shown numerous instances where individuals, often driven by passion conviction and innovation have sparked transformative shifts in the fabric of society. While governments and large institutions wield significant authority, they are often influenced by public opinion and grassroots movements. Individual actions, whether its voting advocating for change or participating in community initiatives, collectively contribute to shaping the agenda and priorities of these entities. It is a symbiotic relationship where individuals and institutions can complement and reinforce each other's efforts to bring about meaningful change.\n"
