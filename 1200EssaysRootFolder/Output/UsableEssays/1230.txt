"vast majority of people around the world don't pay enough attention to their nutrition and lifestyle. And, of course, it often leads to unwanted consequences as different health problems that need to be solved. There are contradictory opinions regarding funding source of healthcare. As for me, I strongly believe that every person should be financial responsible for illnesses which are the result of inappropriate behaviour."
