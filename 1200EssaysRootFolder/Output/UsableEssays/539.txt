"Individuals can do nothing to change society.Any significant changes can only be brought about by governments and large institutions. I agree to this point because individuals can do nothing without the help of government. Many people's mind are very sharp bt many people's minds are very confusing. They always want their success and growth not their neighbours and friends. If the support of government and large institutions are available then some individuals group can do many things what ever many people can't think about that. First of all many people think about themselves only not for anybody. Because almost people are selfish. Some people believe that when you help other person then you get help by themselves. So, be helpful and careful.when they get help by governments and larger institutions then they can do many more ideas and apply their ideas and their thoughts. Please get support for human being and if you will change then you can change the world. We also can say that we can do anything but not individually. We always have to be helped by government and larger institutions. First of all we should think our future . We can help each other for any type of work and situations and conditions. We also need to be helped by everyone for developing the nation our India. Because if an Individual person is trying to do something for all. But everyone wants to get profit. But no one should come forward for any type of struggle and any types of crisis."
