"A vast majority of people around the world don't pay enough attention to their nutrition and lifestyle. And, of course, it often leads to unwanted consequences as different health problems that need to be solved. There are contradictory opinions regarding funding source of healthcare. As for me, I strongly believe that every person should be financial responsible for illnesses which are the result of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nFirst of all, it motivates both men and women to\n\nexclude as more bad habits as they can to save their money. It is absolutely obvious that citizens who don't worry about their own condition and needs of the organism should pay additional charge for medical insurance. For example, in some countries medical companies require patients to notify if they have particular bad habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, lack of exercise and others. And the more they have the more they force to pay. Thus, it would decrease person's desire to buy harmful products or to smoke and make them to be more physically active."
