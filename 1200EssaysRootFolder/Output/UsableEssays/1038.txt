"Technological development relates to really anything in regards to inventions or innovations. Development is essentially the process that takes a product or idea from a hypothesis to a usable product. More often than not, development is usually restarted after a product is finished, which is known as a prototype, which means it was a testing to determine if the technology was ready for regular usage.\n\nAn example of this was laser technology; back 60 years ago, they were most likely tested in a secret lab funded by the government, most likely for military application. Once it passed R&D (research and development), prototypes were sent out to be field tested. They were large, probably the size of something you could fit on the back of a flatbed.\n\nEventually, the tech became more condensed and was modified to more portable applications, such as range finders, laser designators and aim assistance for long arms. By the late 70s, the public eye was able to SLOWLY get the technology. Roll ahead thirty years and lasers are micro sized and used for surgery, printing etc.\n\nThats just an example in a nutshell of developme"
