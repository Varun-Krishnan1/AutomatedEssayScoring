"In this modern era, one view is always considered in mind that whether older people or youth of this time is much more effective, then in my opinion senior natives of any nation are better option to choose when  coming for ac activity, task or duty for team leaders.. This is to admit that they are obtained with an abundance of experience in the field they did tasks in their younger age, they gave their bests as per the requirements of the jobs they were assigned. Moreover, the works used to be done in the previous times were mostly manual and consisting hard work with detailed knowledge of the things they are going to use. thus, on that basis I strongly hold the perspective that older people with expert thoughts are always better option to choose for leadership goals. This will not only make any team succeed, but also help other teammates to show their full potential towards the duties they are assigned. This contribution will help in make the confidence level of every team member high and provide them skills in that field. Under the guidance of older people, youngers can learn how to use their free time productively and by imparting their life experience they are able to make young teammates success with the time they are given and be loyal to the work. Even more, the morals which old individuals have can leave a good impact on young generation as well as they will get to know a lot from their leaders if they are belonging to old generation."
