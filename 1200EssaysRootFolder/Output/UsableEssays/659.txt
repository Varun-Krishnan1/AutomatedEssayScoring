"\n\n\n\n\nTo account for this \"great diversity of thought, experience and behavior within generations,\" Pew will reframe generational research in the context of \"age cohorts\": groupings of people who were born in a particular time frame who might have experienced major societal events in meaningfully similar ways. \"For example, it could be a group/cohort that came of age politically when Obama was president, or it could be young adults who were in college during the pandemic, or we could group people by birth decade,\" a Pew spokesperson said.\n\n\"The question isn't whether young adults today are different from middle-aged or older adults today,\" Parker wrote. \"The question is whether young adults today are different from young adults at some specific point in the past.\"\n\nPew's announcement raises questions about the validity of the stream of generational content we've been served. IAre 20-year-olds always just 20-year-olds? At its core, Pew's decision makes clear that generations  and the distinctions we draw between them  are simply made up."
