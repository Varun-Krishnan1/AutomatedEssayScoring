"Above-mentioned statements are truly mean in it .As it says a individual can do anything to change the society because as it verbed if individual changes comes from home .each individual cansider to  be a home , all home consider to  be a society . If basic change happens in individuals it automatically changes the society ,  when individual try to change the things from the basic level  eventually major things will aslo change in the society, hence I strongly believe that if change can happen in individual person the society also can be changed from all circumstances.Therefore, individual can do nothing to change society.any significant changes can only be brought about by government and large institutions. If no change in individuals automatically the government will take the control of everything."
