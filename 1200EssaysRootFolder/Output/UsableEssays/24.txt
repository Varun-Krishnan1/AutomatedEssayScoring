"Older people are often more respected by others. Therefore, they can have a more powerful voice within the company,and people are more likely to listen to them. If leaders are young, they might fine it hard to influence other employees.                           Experience is the best teacher.It is the main reason why I strongly believe the most successful leaders are the older people who have many experience in their life.                                                                       The skills of leadership are totally depends on how many times on individual have over came the issues in their teams successfully."
