"Now a days money is given respect ,not the people.Earning money is an important part of life.it allows an individual to make a living and take responsibility. The genuine satisfication derived from establishing a coherent balance will make us realize what deserves to be in put on the time table and thereby prioritized in an ever more competent manner.\nso many a time, the choice is a mateer of how we look rather than look we howled? That exasperated state ensues when we are lacking adequate awareness of what it is pecisely that we ought to chennelize oue focus upon and then that little bit keeps on perpetuating with its weirdness of enormous intriguing perplexities that i am doing it all right - but then wheream i going wrong ?\nThe point might be somewhere in between /wit-wean where the aims -growing -leaning-wrongly........\nFor this might not be noticiable understandably due to the hectic schedules and so much more that prominently keeps emerging -bt that is what the whole/total process gets hampered and boggeddown is when something as inconspicious as a little bit -bites all the ever more-it is not that twnty meeny bit lodgedsomewhwre surreptiusly for no reason -it is more of the lessons of lifes resonance that never-never and never ever to take things-matters far too much for granted or just keep on venturing in an auto piolet/automated mode and then there will keep on emerging various other aspects that will each intend to keep resonating its fabled adage of prevention is better than cure-that once bitten twice shy which is not just for any poetic humming, but the actual legitimate principle of how each and every element of life truly re-oresents........whwther we merely take lead or appropriately pay due heed-attention as well ?\nHuman beings need money to pay for all the things that make your life possible,such as shelter,food,healthcare bills,and a good education.You dont necessarily need to ne Bill Gates or have a lot of money to pay for these things,but you will need some money untill the day you die."
