"older people are often more respected by others. Therefore, they can have a more powerful voice within the company, and people are more likely to listen to them. If leaders are young, they might find it hard to influence other employees. Experienced leaders are more likely to have developed organizational, time management, and planning skills over the course of their careers. They're also more stable and reliable and have been shown to have solid decision-making skills."
