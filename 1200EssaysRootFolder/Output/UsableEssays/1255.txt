"Nowadays, Lot of people are having health issues due to poor diets or what we call \" JUNK FOOD/FAST FOOD\" ,\nwhich people think that they have to pay more for health care because it's their own mistake \n\nFirst of all , there is no control over eating junk food or fast food , because lot of people are in a hurry , maybe they need to go back to their work as soon as possible , so we cant judge people over this , second ,i think everyone is free to eat whatever they want unless isnt something toxic or touching others safety , But from the other point , the unhealthy lifestyles would absolutely touch others rest , and it's not acceptable at all which make them in a case that they need to pay more for health care .\n\npersonally i would eat whatever i want not wanting paying more for health care , but i prefer to eat healthy and have a good body , but i will never have that unhealthy lifestyles because it hurts others more than me .\n"
