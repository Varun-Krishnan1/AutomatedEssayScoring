As many new high tech instruments have changed the way that people live many earlier technologies also had a lot of impacts.\nTo begin with, I should compare some new technologies with older . For example new mobile systems such as android or ios during 8 or 9 years ago have had such important impacts on the way people communicate to each other . As  inventing mobile had change the world about twenty years ago but these new high tech mobiles have also changed the lives .A survey conducted on the recent technological developments  revealed that many people think their behaviours have changed.\nOn the contrary, Many earlier technological developments Such as inventing refrigerator, Television, Metro have also had a lot of impacts on the lives of people.\nTo conclude,I cant say which technological developments earlier or recent brought more benefits as both of them are important and made the lives of people more simple .\n\n"
