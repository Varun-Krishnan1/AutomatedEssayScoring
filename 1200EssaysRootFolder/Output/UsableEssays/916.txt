"Encouraging children to do part time job during their leisure time is becoming nowadays. Even though it helps to develop the habit of hardworking and confidence in children, it has some drawbacks as well.\n\nFirstly, part time jobs will help the children to understand and experience the      difficulties and hardships parents face during their everyday day life to raise them.      This will surely enable them to appreciate the hard work of their parents and children will try to          share some of the responsibilities. They will understand the need for sharing and      caring. Working in a team will help children understand the             importance of interdependence and accepting the peers. A part time job also gives them a taste of their future life and will help them to organise their life in a disciplined manner and teach them how to balance personal life and work\n\n"
