"I disagree with the view that a country can not develop its economy and protect the environment at the same time. The purposes of economic development and environmental protection are the same, and both are to meet the needs of the people for a better life. The contents of the two complement each other and can be transformed into each other. On the one hand, if the ecological environment is well protected and the quality of the ecological environment is improved, the economic development will be sustainable and the development space will be broader. On the other hand, economic development can provide a solid material guarantee for the protection and restoration of the ecological environment and provide people with more high-quality ecological products. \nCircular economy is an economic growth model that takes the efficient utilization and recycling of resources as the core, the principle of \"reduction, reuse and recycling\", and the basic characteristics of low consumption, low emission and high efficiency, in line with the concept of sustainable development. The operation mode of circular economy will greatly reduce the demand for new resources and completely eliminate the discharge of untreated waste in production and life. It is conducive to the formation of a production model and consumption mode that saves resources and protects the environment. Developing the circular economy can reach the goal of developing the economy and protecting the environment at the same time. In this way, the country can achieve the purpose of building a better society for its people."
