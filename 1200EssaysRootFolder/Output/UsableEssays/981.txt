"Technological breakthroughs have indeed a huge impact on peoples everyday lives. However, it is considered that advancements on earlier technology have more significant benefits on majority as compared with the latest discoveries and inventions these could ever offer. On my point of view, even though it is obvious that previous developments are continuously helping our lives, I still believe that the recent ones would definitely change our daily living and probably we will be dependent on these in the near future as well."
