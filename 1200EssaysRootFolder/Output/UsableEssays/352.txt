"Nowadays making friends on internet has been popular throughout the world and also the internet helps the people from all around the world to connect to each other.  Having online friends is not bad if we understand each other very well and also making friends online is no longer  problem nowadays.\n      On the other hands making friends online may also lead to some trouble because some people also get cheated online so therefor to make friends friends online we have to be very careful to share with them but friends from real life are totally different from friends from online because friends from online they did not last long like friends from real life. Also friends from real life we get to meet them everyday and we also know them very well. a friends from real life also our parents know them so we can trust them and we are comfortable to share them everything unlike friends from online we cannot share every thing because we don't know them very well and cannot trust them.\n     Therefore a friends from online is no substitute for real friends."
