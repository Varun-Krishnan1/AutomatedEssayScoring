"One of the famous quotes which is often used to illustrate why we should not be attached to money is that of Alexander the Great, who is reported to have said \"when you bury my body, don't build any momentum and keep my hands outside so that the world knows that the person who won the whole world had nothing in his hand while dying.\" Admittedly, there is much more to human life than money and pleasure. However, can we really enjoy a good quality of life without money. Try asking that to the father who cannot afford to provide his children with a proper meal at night or the Malagasy who despite striving hard to earn a living does not have access to running water. For the latter money is can buy happiness since his or her happiness lies in meeting basic needs and having water to drink and batch, adequate food to eat would be qualified as being gold standard quality of life. However, it is very unlikely that the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos would have the same conceptualization of quality of life. Quality of life is defined differently for those who have enough money to fulfill their basic needs. For example, as per the Maslows Hierarchy of Needs, quality of relationships might be of greater importance. For others it might be achievement at the workplace. Ultimately, one should move beyond all the ego needs to focus on growth. It is true that in todays worlds much emphasis is placed on money and we forget that money is only a means to an end, never the end itself. "
