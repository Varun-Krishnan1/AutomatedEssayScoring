"I empathise with Moya Lothian-McLeans article on withdrawing from social media (2 May). I also tended to post a lot, but Covid has taught me that of my 360-odd Facebook friends, only a select few have bothered to check up on me during the past two difficult years, when I was alone for much of the time. Real friends are the ones who are there for you in hard times, and do things like drop by with a bunch of flowers, offer to do a bit of shopping, or ring up for a chat.

That is why we keep our journalism open for everyone to read. If this is you, please continue to read for free.\n\nBut if you are able to, then there are THREE good reasons to support us today from India.\n\n1. Our quality, investigative journalism is a scrutinising force at a time when the rich and powerful are getting away with more and more\n\n2. We are independent and have no billionaire owner pulling the strings, so your money directly powers our reporting\n\n3. It doesnt cost much, and takes less time than it took to read this message"
