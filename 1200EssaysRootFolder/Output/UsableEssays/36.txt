If Leaders are young they might find it hard to influence other employees.Older people have their wisdom to make firm, sound and  excellent decisions.This is because they are knowledgeable  and understand the younger people and the surroundings\n\nAgree the Older people  Must better\n\n                               We live in a contemporary world where it has been observed that some people refer to have older people take the lead as they believe older citizen hold much more experience then a young generation. However, I am completely opposed to the statement and my reason  will be explained in the following paragraphs.\n                                 TO begin with, in recent scenarios, it can  be noticed that, higher position at the work place are dominated by older people as they are more experienced, because they have spend years in the field to be an expert to lead a team. A similar scenario can also be seen in the p[olitical department where aged people are working as the leader to develop the country.\n\nDis Agree the Older people  Must better\n While some people believe that the younger people lead the organisation. Some people said that it is better to promote a younger person to a leader ship position.Some residents belive it would be much better than with a younger leader , while others argue the opposite . in the view of point younger people will lead the position effectively and gratefully.\nConclusion\nThis about how strongly about the older people argue and support about ideas.\n"
