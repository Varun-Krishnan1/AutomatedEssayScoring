"In the present situation standing on the 77th year of  Independence our country there are so many Social reformers like Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, swami Vivekananda ,Rabindranath Tagore , Raja Rammohun Roy & Vidyasagar they have shown the path of future. The people of India follow them as the Real hero's and try to follow the path shown by them, Each of the above mentioned person has their private life which we try to know .the newspaper can give the proper information about their private life.But as per my opinion for the betterment of the society the newspapers should not release any negative part of the famous people which might have bad impact on the society."
