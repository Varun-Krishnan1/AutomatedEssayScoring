"Today's world is governed and directed by governments and powerful institutions that have the power to make new changes that impact the lives of numerous individuals. Individuals try to change and make attempts to modify society, but it takes time for such improvements to take shape. I partially disagree with the statement about individuals not being able to bring about change."
