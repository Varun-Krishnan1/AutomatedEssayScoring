"Few people believe that only money is more valuable and can provide good quality of life compared to free time. In my opinion free time is more valuable than the money to live a good and happy and quality family. Money can be earned anytime but time we can regain it. It's a nice brainer that the significance of money has grown steadily over the past few years. There is a famous saying that \"Money is not everything in life, but it is something\". Although some believe that money is more important than the leisure time. It is believed that money is vital for the virtue of life instead of leisure time."
