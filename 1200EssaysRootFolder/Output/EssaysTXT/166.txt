"Protecting the natural environment gradually becomes significant nowadays. As we human beings only have one Earth, it is important to care about the planet we are living. Nevertheless, developing and making progress in technology, economy are also important for countries if they want the citizens to have a better life, while I suggest that when a country becomes richer, the natural environment will suffer.\nFirst of all, when a country wants to boost their economy, the country must develop their business all over the world and collaborate with other countries, which means they need to put a great amount of money in developing transportation. However, transportation costs a lot of gasoline and natural resources, leading to a negative impact on the environment. \nMoreover, harming the environment is almost inevitable when a country is developing since industry must be an important factor in enhancing economy. Taking China as an example, we can notice that the capital of China, Beijing, was having a really bad air condition in the past few years because of the increasing amount of industry and buildings. \nOn the other hand, if a country is already rich enough, they can stop those action which harming the environment. Instead, they can start to promote the idea of creating environment friendly products, decreasing carbon footprints in the city. But for those countries which still trying to be developed, they need to pay the cost and no one can do it without losing anything. Hence, it is impossible for a country to develop its economy while protecting the environment at the same time. "
