"Quality of life is a highly subjective measure of happiness that is an essential component of many financial decisions. Factors that play a role in the quality of life vary according to personal preferences, but they often include financial security, job satisfaction, family life, health, and safety.Financial decisions can often involve a trade off wherein quality of life is decreased to save money or earn more money. Conversely, quality of life can be increased by spending more money."
