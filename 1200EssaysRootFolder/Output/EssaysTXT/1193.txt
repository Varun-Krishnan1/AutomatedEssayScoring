"argument from myside-  yes I think that people who make themselves ill should pay more because people who can buy food for themselves   know that which food is healthy for them and which is harmful for their health. if they have the ability to make themselves ill they often have an option to make their lives healthy.  they should prefer more healthy food for them selves and their family. every thing begins from home, from the elders or ideals of the family . if they each them that adapting healthy life style is very essential  for happy, healthy and long life. they consume unhealthy and junk food as a habit and gets addicted to it. AT THE END  IWULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME, MONEY, HEALTH YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON CONSUMING HEALTHY AND NUTRICIOUS FOOD FOR A HEALTHY AND BETTER LIVING.                         \n              ARGUMENTS FROM OTHERS  SIDE       \n  The people from other side said that not all people are the same and they spoil their health intentionally. some people donot have a lot have a lot of money to buy healthy and nutrictional food  and to build their lives healthy. people with less income or less literacy have less knowledge about healthy food. so    we cannot say that everyone are intentionally spoiling their healts.
