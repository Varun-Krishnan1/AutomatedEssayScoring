"In the modern, it is effortless for most of people in the world to make friend whether it is by meeting physically or by the social media as having friend from these platforms is the nine in a ten situation. However, choosing a loyal friend is the difficult task for everyone. in this time and era, the society has mean nature that they cannot be so supportive to their friends at every place. they play an opposite role sometime too. \nFriendship from social sites is the most complicated task, as there are number of people have fake profiles. In this world, they have no honest nature to everyone. this time is so mean that they are not able to show their true behavior. social media apps are considered to be very much fake in this world to trap people there are many people who are there just to enjoy on having fun of others.\nIn contrast, making friends meeting them personally is the easy task until we are good at recognizing people from their conversation in one quick talk. It is human nature that they easily get attracted to a person who does good to them, but at the same time they hate to that who does a bit wrong to them.\n\nAll in all, in my opinion, I prefer to have friends by meeting them physically and having brief conversation with them. \n"
