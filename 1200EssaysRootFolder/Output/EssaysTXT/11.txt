"It has been argued that older people tend to be better leaders. One of the reasons proposed for their enhanced leadership ability is experience, both in their professional and personal lives. This is believed to have equipped them with the resiliience and fortitude to not just deal with the different problems which life throws at them but also to help others navigate the vicissitudes of life. However, as this essay argues, the co-assocation between increasing age and enhanced leadership can also be a flawed one.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the older an individual is, the more likely it is that he/ she has been exposed to a range of positive and negative experiences, both in their personal and professional lives. Assuming that these have served as valuable learning opportunities, one can reach the conclusion that older people tend to be better leaders since they are in the privileged position of drawing from a wider range of experience than their younger counterparts. Experience brings with it not just wisdom but also a sense of confidence in one's ability to weather difficult times. This would also potentially explain the enhanced leadership ability of older individuals.\n\nHowever, it should also be borne in mind that in many cases, age might just be a number. A highly motivated and capable individual who has been able to climb the career ladder faster, might be able to amass more experience in a shorter span of time. Arguably, in his/her case, it is aptitude rather than age which has a more decisive role to play. Self-confidence is also not age-dependent. Therefore, it could also be argued that it is the right set of skills rather than chronological age which  determines an individual's leadership ability."
