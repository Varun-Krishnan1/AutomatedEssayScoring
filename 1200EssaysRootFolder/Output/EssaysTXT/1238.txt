"Yes, i agree to this that people have to pay more for their healthcare if something big health problems came into their life because their hospital bill can exceed their normal daily life diets. I saw many people loosing all their properties, money, cash, jwellery and everything to save their life. so it's better to take care of their health before it came something big."
