"Earlier technological progress had been great with many far-reaching breakthroughs,\nespecially in the early period of the last century. However, the benefits and changes\nbrought by the earlier technological developments to the lives of ordinary people\ncannot compare with those brought by recent ones. Therefore, I disagree with the\ngiven statement. In the following paragraphs, I intend to support my opinion with my\narguments.\nUndoubtedly, recent technological developments have benefited and changed our life\nso much that we enjoy almost all the comforts and conveniences that life can ever\noffer. Today, we can breakfast in Japan, lunch in Singapore and dine at New Delhi. This\nis all because of the faster means of travel. The Internet has revolutionised\ncommunication. Today we send and receive e-mails at the click of a mouse. We chat\nand do video conferencing with our kith and kin in any part of the world. These are\njust two examples of how dramatically recent technological developments have\nbenefited and changed our life.\nFurthermore, in the field of medicine, we have gadgets to diagnose cancers and many\nother diseases at such early stages that almost complete cures are possible. Also, if we\nlook at the means we use to go to work, the electrical appliances we use at home, the\ndevices we use in offices, the facilities and equipments we use in factories, we can say\nwith certainty that recent technology has transformed our lives beyond imagination."
