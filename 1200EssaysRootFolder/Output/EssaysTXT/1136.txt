"First of all a person's diet depends greatly on how much money they can  spend on food, healthier organic meals  cost a lot of money while garbage food is cheaper. \nwhile i'm not saying this is main reason why some people have adopted unhealthy lifestyles it is important to note that a lot of people eat unhealthy food because simply that all they can afford so it is sort of unfair to make them pay more money for health care, it would be like punishing them for being poor by making them even more poor and charging them extra for health care.\nHowever, there are certain factors that contribute to unhealthy lifestyles that can be easily avoided by the individual such as smoking and drinking, if the illness is caused by smoking or doing drugs then i think it's fair to charge them more for healthcare not to punish them but to raise awareness .\n"
