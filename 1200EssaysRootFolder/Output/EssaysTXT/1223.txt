"I think this is a topic that is not often talked about, and for this reason I have never asked myself such a question. despite this I think that everyone should feel free to live their life as they prefer. \nI also believe that this choice should not affect the right to medical services, if a person eats \"junk food\" every day he has the same right to health as someone who eats fruit and vegetables. the idea that those who don't take care of themselves have to pay more for medical treatment is insane from my point of view."
