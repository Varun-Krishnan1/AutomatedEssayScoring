"a vast majority of people around the world dont pay enough attention to their nutrition and lifestyle and of course it often leads to unwantwd consequences as differentbhealth problems that need to be solved there are contradictory opinions regarding funding sourtce ofnhealthcare as for me i strongly believe that every person should be financial responsible for illnesses which are the result of inappropriate behaviour \nparents and family of childrens are allloweing them to eat junk fast food which is making very dangours healtn issues\nand for the poor health parents are responsible for their health issues because they are busy in their work due to which Childers are not getting proper food   and eating outside street food which is very unhealthy \nso with this i want to say that parents should look their childrens and family and provide healthy diet "
