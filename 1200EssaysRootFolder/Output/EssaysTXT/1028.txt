"Hi, Good afternoon. My name is Sharanamma. Okay, I am agree with this earlier technological developments brought more benifits and changed the lives of ordinary people more than recent technological developments. now days people dependent on technology without technology or without internet can't live long time people. improving technology time saving we can do another work. Nowdays without drive we can moves the car. then people get unemployed. electrical cars also introduced we can reduce sound pollution, air pollution etc. Technology increasing Unemployment increasing. robort also using in hotel, ladge. But poor people is sufferring. So try to reduce using technologies. Thank you."
