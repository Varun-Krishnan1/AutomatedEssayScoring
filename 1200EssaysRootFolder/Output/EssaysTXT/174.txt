"The fight between Environment  and Economy\n\nTo some extent, I agree with this statement. Firstly, looking back at the history, the  developed countries had polluted the earth environment severely. They are urging the world to protect our surrounding for two reasons. One reason is that with the help of high-end technology, they can achieve the economic goals while also limiting the comsuption of energy or resources. The other reason is to suppress developing countries' speed of economic expansion. The history book hasn't recorded any developed country that rose themselves up without harming the environment. \n\nMore importantly, I reckon that it all comes down to the fact that our resources are limited. And a giant growing economy means that people are consuming more resources than before. Therefore, I agree that when a country becomes richer, the natural environment will suffer.\n\n"
