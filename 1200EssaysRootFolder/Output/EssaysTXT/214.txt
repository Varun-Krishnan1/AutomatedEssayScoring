"Some people argue that is more important to have an enjoyable job than to earn a lot of money. Others disagree and think that a good salary leads to a better life.\n\nHaving an enjoyable job is the dream of everyone, having the pleasure to go to work and spend the days doing something we like sounds amazing.  Nowadays people want to have the perfect job with the perfect salary to have the perfect lifestyle in order to be able to travel throughout the world, to have a good house where to live, to enjoy dinners out, but those jobs are hard to find.\n\nSome people believe that the most important is to have an enjoyable job no matter how much the salary is. A pleasant job means happiness on our daily basis, because it isnt seen as job anymore, its seen as a hobby. However, in the end of the month everyone needs to have enough money to eat and to pay their bills. Its crucial to find a job that we like and allows at least to survive at the end of the month."
