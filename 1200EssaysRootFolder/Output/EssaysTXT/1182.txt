"he Causes of An Unhealthy Diet There are many causes for an unhealthy diet. The causes themselves can range from person to person but generally there are some that are identical from one person to another. The general causes that stand out the most include personal expense believing current eating habits is healthy enough and knowing a change is needed but doing little to change it.\nlongside the advertisements for fast food, the government spend huge amounts of money (but not a fraction of that of McDonalds) on advertisements urging us to eat well, move more. The government has also spent 640k on new ads using Homer Simpson urging us to give up the doughnuts. Hardly a healthy role model: Homer is seen replacing his usual popcorn with a healthier snack and encouraging his family to do the same. One thing the Simpsons do enjoy is family meals around the dining table  another aspect of family life which is dying out and being replaced by TV dinners. Ironically the Simpsons used to be sponsored by Dominoes pizza until Ofcom ruled it inappropriate. Dominoes are another giant who have navigated their way around the new rules by advertising within family shows such as Im a celebrity which attracts young views in millions."
