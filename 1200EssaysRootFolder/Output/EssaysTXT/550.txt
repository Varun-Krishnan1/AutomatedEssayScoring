"A Healthy and Happy Life relies entirely on society, which is worsening as global urbanization increases. some people think that government alone are incapable of making any kind of contribution. According to me Every individual is Important for society growth. In order to initiate changes in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With strong financial foundations, governments can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific research and paying for the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development. Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, the government Awards study grants and scholarships for deserving pupils This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils.\n\nSecondly, the social influences from governments and large corporations also bring changes on a larger scale. By improving regulations and laws, governments can affect the public behaviors on a national level through civil obligation. Large corporations can influence societies too by being a leading role in their industries. This way individuals are also accountable to the responsibilities towards the betterment of a society. Furthermore, governments are shaped by individuals. As a result, both individuals and governments should accompany each other in order to prepare healthier community conditions."
