"Is multitasking a good thing? While multitasking seems like a great way to get a lot done at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think they are. In fact, some research suggests that multitasking can actually hamper your productivity by reducing your comprehension, attention, and overall performance.1\nJeong S-H, Hwang Y. Media multitasking effects on cognitive vs. attitudinal outcomes: A meta-analysis. Hum Commun Res. 2016;42(4):599-618. doi:10.1111/hcre.12089\n\n\nWhat is it that makes multitasking such a productivity killer? It might seem like you are accomplishing multiple things at the same time, but what you are really doing is quickly shifting your attention and focus from one thing to the next. Switching from one task to another may make it difficult to tune out distractions and can cause mental blocks that can slow you down.\n\nExamples of Multitasking\nStarting two projects at the same time\nListening to the radio while driving to work\nTalking on the phone while typing an assignment\nWatching television while responding to work emails\nScrolling through social media while in a meeting\nListening to a person talk while writing a to-do list\nHow Multitasking Hampers Productivity\nMultitasking takes a serious toll on productivity. Our brains lack the ability to perform multiple tasks at the same timein moments where we think we're multitasking, we're likely just switching quickly from task to task.2 Focusing on a single task is a much more effective approach for several reasons.\n\nMultitasking Is Distracting\nMultitaskers may feel more distracted than people who focus on one task at a time. This makes sense when you consider that, by habit, multitaskers constantly refocus on a new task, effectively distracting themselves from their original assignment.\nSome research suggests that multitaskers are more distractible, and they may have trouble focusing their attention even when they're not working on multiple tasks at once.3\n\nOther research shows that while there may be a connection between multitasking and distraction, that link is smaller than originally thought and varies quite a bit from person to person.4\n\nMultitasking Slows You Down\nWhile it may seem contrary to popular belief, we tend to work slower and less efficiently when we multitask.2 Multitasking leads to what psychologists call \"task switch costs,\" or the negative effects that come from switching from task to task. We encounter task switch costs (like a slower working pace) because of the increased mental demand that's associated with jumping from one thing to another.\n\nChanging our focus also keeps us from relying on automatic behaviors to finish tasks quickly. When we're focused on a single task that we've done before, we can work on \"autopilot,\" which frees up mental resources. Switching back and forth bypasses this process, and we tend to work more slowly as a result.2\n\nMultitasking Impairs Executive Function\nMultitasking is managed by executive functions in the brain. These control and manage cognitive processes and determine how, when, and in what order certain tasks are performed. There are two stages to the executive control process:5\n\nGoal shifting: Deciding to do one thing instead of another\nRule activation: Changing from the rules for the previous task to the rules for the new task\nMoving through these stages may only add a few tenths of a second, but it can start to add up when people switch back and forth repeatedly. This might not be a big deal when you are folding laundry and watching television at the same time.\nHowever, if you are in a situation where safety or productivity is important, such as when you are driving in heavy traffic, even small amounts of time can prove critical.\n\nMultitaskers Make Mistakes\nMultitasking may lower your performance and make you more prone to making mistakes.2 Research has shown that students who multitask in class tend to have lower GP"
