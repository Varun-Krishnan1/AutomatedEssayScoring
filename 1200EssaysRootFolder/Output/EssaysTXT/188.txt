"Quality of life is a non-financial component associated with job and life satisfaction. When used in a work-related way, qualify of life often refers to the time and ability to do the thing you enjoy. If a job pays a lot of money but requires so many working hours that the worker cannot enjoy any of the money earned, that is a poor quality of life.\nIf a job provides time to enjoy life but leaves the worker too tired, injured, stressed out, or otherwise unable to enjoy their earnings, this is another detriment to the quality of life. Today, it is common to weigh both salary and quality of life when considering how good or bad a job is.Quality of life is also an issue when developing a personal savings plan. In this case, the trade off involves sacrificing the current quality of life to improve the future quality of life. This may include limiting immediate spending by purchasing lower-cost items rather than buying higher-cost, premium items."
