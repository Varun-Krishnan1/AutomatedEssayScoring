"Individuals can do nothing to change society. New developments can be only brought about by governments and large institutions.\n\nMaking substantial changes in society has always been a major concern for every nation. It is believed that these changes can be made only by the government, whereas others argue that an individual can make a differences and eventually change the society. In my opinion, the influences from the former are by far more significant than that from the individual owing to financial consideration and their authorities.\n\nIn order to initiate change in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With strong financial foundations, government  can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific research and playing for the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development.  Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, the government Awards study grants and scholarship for deserving pupils This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils."
