"Youth are the future of today, these are the young people of today's world who carry the hope of the future. They are individuals with dreams and aspiration, they are positive and have passion for what they do. Some succeed while some just lose their way because of certain expectations that have been endowed to them by their parents and their adults\n\nYouths of todays have a good and easy upbringing than the old times where even medical facilities were hard to get. The previous generations had to go long road just to attend the school and since the country was not developed and population was a bit less there were many opportunities for them. They could go into trade from one village to another. Though their early years of upbringing may be tough they tide through it will power and grit. This really makes their mind stronger and they were more confident in what they do . problem that they faced while they were small the problems then faced when they started working seems way lighter.\n\nAbout the current generations, which are the today youths are kind of weak in will power but their imaginations are quite big, they are innovate in their own way and can do work more efficiently but they are a bit weak in their mindset. They would give up quite quickly as they haven't struggle much early in their days. But there are individuals who have been struggling since their childhood. Current generation is very competitive if you don't have a developed or high skill level you're likely to get replaced.\ny\nIn conclusion, I would say that people have been struggling and will be struggling, they will be pressured by expectation or to survive in this current world. one has to be strong willed and with an imaginative mind so he can innovate ways to make his work efficient."
