"I think it comes down to personal priorities. I can only speak from the position of a musician but a lot of musicians trade income for doing what they love. Realistically they could make more money doing something else but they cant imagine doing anything else with their lives. For some people making money by doing something they dont like is fine. Some people get to make a lot of money by doing what they enjoy. Its just that I watched my grandfather almost work himself to death while working for the federal government. He had to retire early because of the toll the hours and stress took on his health. But the pay was really good and he could afford to buy things for his family so to him it was worth it. So I think a lot of people do focus to much on money, but I understand the reasons"
