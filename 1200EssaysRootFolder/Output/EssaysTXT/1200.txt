"Healthcare costs all over the world are rising due to the rise in modern diseases which are a product of unhealthy lifestyles. These Lifestyles include poor diet, smoking and lack of exercise. While many people do not need to use medical services, there are others who constantly need medication due to their unhealthy daily lives.\nFirst of all, it is important to highlight the fact that ignorance is not an excuse. Information about health and fitness is widely available so everyone should know that smoking and eating fast food are not only bad for our health, but can cause serious diseases.\nSecondly, it is clear that certain types of treatment are very expensive and some diseases can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle. If people who are obese require treatment, they are taking money away from another patient, whose operation or treatment may be costly, but necessary.\nIn conclusion, making people contribute towards the cost of medical treatment for self-inflicted diseases could help reduce this type of disease and make more money available for other people."
