"An online friendship doesnt offer our kids the opportunity to have experiences together that form bonds. If they arent going to the beach together or shooting hoops or doing the things teens do, they arent seeing each other in a range of contexts and with a range of people. They arent building the skills that go with changing social dynamics and situations.\n\nOnline friends dont see you fall over in the corridor at school. So, they dont have the opportunity to help you up and then laugh it off with you. Those experiences create connection and trust. Instead, online friends see a fairly well-crafted version of you in a situation that is largely static and controllable."
