"Society is trying to make children self independent and also be helpful to both the family and the world. Many parents nowadays see lots of reason why their children should engage in part time job during their leisure time. This helps to provide a means of income to maintain the family financial stability. Also, engaging in part time job exposes the children to having several experiences which enables them to fit into the society. It also facilitates children having sense of responsibility at their tender age. In the same vein, they will be able to cater for their needs also."
