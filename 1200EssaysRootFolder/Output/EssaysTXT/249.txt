"I'm Here to argue with the topic.\nWhy people will not succeed unless they have freedom? Not only strict people succeeds in life. It all depends upon the bond between parents and children. When parents stricts them all the time they are not even able to expose their taught. People who have given freedom they have ability to expose their taught and succeed. Strict childrens are pressurized in their lives they have been dumped in their taughts. So even freedom children can succeed.\n\nI'm here to support the topic\nAlways give a freedom with no doubt. Then children can rapo a bond with parents and they goal. Don't pressure the children with your taughts and dreams. Let children live with their own taught and dreams give them they freedom definitely they will succeed in life."
