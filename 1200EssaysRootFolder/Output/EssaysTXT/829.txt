"Nowadays, it's common practice to encourage kids to work part-time jobs during their free time. Although it aids in instilling confidence and the habit of hard effort in children, it also has significant disadvantages.\nPart-time employment will firstly assist the kids in comprehending. In addition, it will also allow them to experience the challenges and sufferings their parents go through on a daily basis in order to raise them. Children will attempt to share some of the obligations, and they will be able to appreciate the effort put forward by their parents as a result. They will recognise the value of giving and caring. Children will learn the value of interdependence and accepting their peers by participating in group activities.\nA part-time job also gives them a taste of their future and teaches them how to discipline their lives, and organise them. Further, learn to strike a balance between their personal and professional lives.\n"
