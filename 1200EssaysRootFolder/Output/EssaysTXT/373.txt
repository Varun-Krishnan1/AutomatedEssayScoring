"Online friends are people you dont really really know but you met them once at a conference, on a social networking site, on Twitter, or maybe you added them to your Facebook because theyre friends with someone you know. Plus theyre hot, and you do enjoy collecting Facebook friends based on their hotness. An online friend is someone you know is available every time you see that little green dot next to their name, so you write them and say hello. But sometimes its possible to have an online best friend who youve never met before in real life, but who keeps you company when youre writing a long paper or bored at work. You talk to each other at least every other day. You even have inside jokes and think about going out to visit them wherever they live, you know, to take things to the next step."
