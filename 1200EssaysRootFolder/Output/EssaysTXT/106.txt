"To begin with in recent scenarios, it can be noticed that higher positions at the workplace are dominated by the older people as they are most experienced, because they have spent years in that filed to be an expert to lead team. While fresh graduates are encouraged to join entry level positions at the first phase of their working career and as they spend years working under supervision to gain experience later. A similar scenario can also be seen in the political department where aged people are working as a leader  to develop the country.\nFor example, if an older person is assigned as a team leader at a technology development sector and that person has expertise in technological items that were widely used previously but now it is not the same picture then it will be a problem for that person to cope with the situation and create correct development for a new generation."
