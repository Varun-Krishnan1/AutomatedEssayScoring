"Israels chief rabbi is seen as a figure of influence throughout the Orthodox Jewish community, but he is not seen as a leader of the religion. In the United States, the Rabbinical Assembly oversees conservative Jewish rabbis and the Central Conference of American Rabbis oversees reformed Jewish rabbis. The appropriate Jewish community votes on membership for these bodies. Leadership within the governing bodies is decided by scholarship and aptitude."
