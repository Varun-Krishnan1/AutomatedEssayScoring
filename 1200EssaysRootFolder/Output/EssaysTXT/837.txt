"Many children are encouraged by their parents to get a part-time job in their free time because the parents think that the child will get work experience from this and also it will make good use of a child's free time. This part-time job is also an extra source of income for the household and it can even help with some of the financial problems of the family. There is also the flip side to the argument that getting a part-time job is a waste of time. Some people believe that getting a part-time job will ruin their free time and they won't get time enough to relax or do a hobby they did in their free time. My take is that we should balance everything and take a part-time job. This can help one even if he/she lives alone with all the financial problems and a person can always take out time to do the things they love. It increases a person's experience and opens up more job opportunities with companies that only hire experienced professionals. If a person is not doing anything in their free time then this can help them get out of a boring place. Getting a job helps with accepting responsibilities and carrying them out. It also helps with getting out of the lazy zone which prevents anything from being done. "
