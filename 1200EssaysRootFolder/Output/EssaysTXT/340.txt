"If we walk in the center of a big city like Milan, we notice that almost all the people walk in a hurry focused on their business affairs without thinking about what surrounds them. This happens because they give too much importance to work since it makes them get more money. \nMoney nowadays seems to have become the primary purpose of people's lives but it shouldn't be like that, indeed, in my opinion, the humanity should think more about things like people who surround them, feelings and nature. These three things are really important because they can improve the quality of our lives, giving us happiness.\nObviously we can't say that money is not important, they allows us to eat, to sleep in an house, to drink... Things without which we can't live, but we don't have to be stressed because of work only for gaining more and more money, we should focus much on our happiness.\nThe italian poet of the 20th century Pascoli, unlike his contemporaries, wanted to live his life looking at the beauty of the nature. I think he should be an example to follow because he had the ability of appreciating little things such as a sunset or a field ofwheat and being happy staring at them."
