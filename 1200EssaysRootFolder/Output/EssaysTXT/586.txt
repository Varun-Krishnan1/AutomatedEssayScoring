"  pollution  is a very big challenge for all of us. Pollution is everywhere on lands ,on air even in seas and we are hundred percent responsible for it and I know it is not an easy task to resolve this problem but I can say that it is not impossible too. Always people say that it is not possible  for a single person to resolve this problem but we forget ,counting starts with ZERO. so we should give our best effort like I dont care what people do or not but at least I will follow all those  thing  in which way i can keep a healthy environment ."
