"If you're wondering what makes online friends real, it is partially the social emotional connection you have and partially verifying that they are who they say they are. Before you make online friends real friends, make sure to video chat and talk on the phone.\nEveryone needs friends but the question is why do we need friends? Whether we realize it or not, friends play a very important role in our lives. A friend is your support system away from your family. They are there through your sadness and happiness; they make the good times better and ease hard times. They are someone you can share your troubles, secrets, and joys with, who can understand your thoughts, feelings and help you when you need it the most. But in a world where technology is increasingly expanding, in which the Internet plays a major role in the lives of most people today, it has become easy for people to make friends online. The term friend has transformed into someone you only know through a screen. Although they bear some minor similarities, the differences between real life friends and online friends are profound."
