"Nowadays, parents motivate their children to indulge in various kinds of activities and doing a part time job is one of them. In this essay, I will shed some light on the pros and cons of doing a part time job.\n\nIt is evident that parents are supporting their children to do part time job; thereby, leading to obvious outcomes: the children learn the importance of money and also become a responsible person. Doing part-time job at an early stage of life not only teaches them the importance of earning money, but also prevents them from being a spendthrift. For instance, during my college days, I used to take part-time tuition classes which taught me to save my hard-earned money. Further, working part time also makes the children a responsible person. To exemplify, odd-jobs like a pizza-boy teach the children how the employer is dependent on them to run his business; consequently, they do their work seriously/ sincerely and take complete responsibility."
