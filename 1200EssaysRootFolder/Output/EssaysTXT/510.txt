"I definitely disagree, an online friendship can be more successful than a real one due to many reasons. Sometimes, It can be hard to trust a person online but If you get the opportunity to discover each other and spend much time in texting each other and playing video games for example, it can get serious. I personally have met many people online that I consider now as my real friends and I even had the chance to meet them in face. I'm not saying that a real friendship can't go any further but from my experience I found that online friends always stand by your side than any real friend can do. I've had been through some bad situations and the only people that were my side were my online friends. I don't see any reason for me now to not trust them anymore because they've already showed me loyalty and respect and what friendship truly means. \n\nBesides, an online friendship has its consequences such as scams, or sharing personal information that can affect you negatively but let's not deny the fact that the most persons you would enjoy time with them are online friends. They're special and you get to know people all around the world. If you ask me, I have online friends that are from Canada, US, and even arab countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. I wish to meet them all of them in once but I only had the chance to meet some of them. "
