"When a country becomes richer there are some problems but also positive things about the develop of economy and protect the environment.\nAt first, talking about problems, it can be needed more space to built new houses for people so they can destroy the green areas.\nAt second time it is obvious that the pollution will increase that is a bad thing for the environment but also for the people that live in that areas.\nTalking about good things if a country becomes more rich there can be more job for people and it can helps the poor family.\nMoreover new green areas can be built with games for children or with ponds.\nIn conclusion I think that it is difficult to develop them in the right way but if they are well organized they can succeed."
