"Older people have experience much more and knows how to lead in the society, they are very honest and sincere for they will never have any partiality with anyone in particular. They are willing to listen to others problem the entire time and never jump to conclusion but the decision that they make is very genuine and will never depend on a gadget but through their own skills.\n\nBut on the other hand, the knowledge that they have is not enough, but the older people are always satisfied with the limited knowledge and will never be willing to add more knowledge or to up-date themselves."
