"The topic is an interesting one.  I agree with the author on this point . Newspapers including other medias now a days  seem to go to any length for gaining popularity and increase their market share.Unless it is not in the public interest no one should be allowed to peep in to somebody's private life . When a news report on a famous person private life comes out , the person concerned faces tough time explaining .In reality he is at a loss of words . In some cases the harassment due to report is so much that people lose their balance . Social status is badly affected having having far reaching repercussions . Therefore if it is not in the national and public interest such type of reporting should be discouraged at all levels ."
