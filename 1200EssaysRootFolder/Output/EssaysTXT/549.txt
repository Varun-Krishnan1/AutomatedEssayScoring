"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: My health provider spent enough time with me addressing my needs.\n\nStrongly agree\nSomewhat agree\nNeither agree nor disagree\nSomewhat disagree\nStrongly disagree\nIn the field of survey research, this is called an agree/disagree question (its named after the answer options it uses). This question type uses an agree, disagree scale. Essentially, an agree, disagree scale is a range of answer options that go from strongly agree to strongly disagree. It allows respondents to answer more precisely and it provides you with more nuanced survey responses to analyze. This type of question has been extremely popular among survey researchers for decades. Why?\n\nWell, theyre easy to writeand its a pretty standard question thats used across industries. That being said, research has revealed some challenges with this question type. Well go over two such challenges and share our tips on how to overcome them in a snap.\n\n1. Avoid bias (people like to be likable)\nThe seemingly simple agree/disagree construct has whats called an acquiescence response bias. What we mean by that is, in general, people who answer surveys like to be seen as agreeable. So theyll say they agree when given the choice, regardless of the actual content of the question.\n\nAnother challenge is that the agree/disagree question appears to be so straightforward that researchers sometimes write a whole bunch of questions using the same answer choice options. Then, they put the questions into a matrix question type.\n\nSince an agree/disagree matrix question type packs a lot of information in a small spaceits essentially one question that asks respondents to agree or disagree with a series of statementsrespondents may not be careful about how how they answer these questions.\n\nWe call this phenomenon straight-lining. (Basically, straight-lining is when a respondent moves down a series of statements too quickly, selecting the same answer choice for all.)\n\nObviously, this is a major problem if youre trying to collect accurate data. And, in the case of your doctors office, as a result of straight-lining, you wont be able to use the data you collect to improve services and make informed decisions."
