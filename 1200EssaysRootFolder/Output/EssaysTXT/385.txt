"Friendship is an eternal form of relationship, which is taking its forms depending on the trends. present days we can see virtual friendship as an rising trend with the domination of social media and technology. as it has its own pros and cons , I agree with the given statement that virtual friendship cannot replace the vibe of real friendship.\n \nGenerally, It takes real time interaction for a friendship to blossom. But nowadays the interaction has become more easier because of internet and virtual media , which also enables to meet strangers from every corner of the world and communicate with them without having to meet them. in some cases people get very much attached to their virtual friends without even seeing or meeting them. But , I believe that friendship is a strong bond which is built over real time interaction and making memories."
