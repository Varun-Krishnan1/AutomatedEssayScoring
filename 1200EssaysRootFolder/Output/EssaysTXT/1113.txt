"Sometimes, it seems to be easy to forget that famous people deserve the same respect and privacy as normal people do. \nOne of the biggest problems I see these days, is the social media, how easy is for some people to type a random, rude or disrespectful comment on a post in Facebook or instagram. People usually think they can do it just because of the screen protection, and apparently most of them have the excuse of saying that famous people have public lives as if it was a valid reason to give your opinion about every single decision they make. \nWe should be aware about the huge responsibility that is having a profile on internet, because we are part of a society that is constantly changing and expecting to progress in a good way.
