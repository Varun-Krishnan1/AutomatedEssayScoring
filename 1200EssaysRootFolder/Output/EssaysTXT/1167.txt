"In my opinion on this topic is that it is important to consider how much we spent on health and lifestyle. we are least bothered about the health and our life. Individuals are very expensive, and they should pay more attention to their life and health. I support the opinion. we should have clear awareness about health care and how to treat illness caused by poor diets. The reason is that a lot of people eat unhealthy foods, and they didn't pay more for cure of medical traumas resulting from their unhealthy lifestyles. A vast majority of people don't pay enough attention to their nutrition and lifestyle. and it leads to unwanted consequences and different health problems.\n\nTo conclude, it can be said that, only personal choice is to protect oneself from sickness and protect ourselves from the greater illness and live happily ever after. What is important is that the prevention of health problems and illness is more necessary than treatment. \n\"Prevention is better than cure\". "
