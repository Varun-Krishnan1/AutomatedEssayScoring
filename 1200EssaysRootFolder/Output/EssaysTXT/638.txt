"Parenting is a topic, which is constantly discussed in not only America, but in many parts of the world. Every single person has his or her own opinion on how to be the best parent. And there is no wrong or right in parenting.\nIt is a well-known fact that different cultures have different parenting models, and these models are not always being perceived positively by other cultures. In different cultures parents implement their own variations, which they feel will fit their family.\n\nIn the text Amy Chua tries to persuade her readers into believing that Chinese mothers are superior to Western mothers. She does that by using both statistical and personal evidence, and repeating her point. She draws parallels between the Chinese and the Western way of raising kids, but at the same time she draws a dividing line between them, because they are two very different ways of doing the same thing. She uses biased personal and statistical evidence, and purposefully fails to mention other evidence that opposes her view on parenting.\n"
