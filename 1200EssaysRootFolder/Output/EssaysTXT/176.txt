"I agree with this topic.If one country want to become richer,it will make machine to have iron,so that they will have buildings or weapon,or it will make clothes or paper and so on.Two ways to become rich both need materials from environment.During the time of development,they not only have materials from environment ,but also let useless productions in environment.They have no ways to produce these rubbish in early.As time flies,this phenomenon will gradually worsen.
