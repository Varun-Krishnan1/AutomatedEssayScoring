"yes Iam agree with the statement that students are encoureged by their parents to do part time job as they can hepl their family and pay theur fees or  do what they want but i also think that studentd should not be encoureged in doing work it is because it s their study time  if they will work  due to which they will not be able to study and do something bbetter for their future and have standard living  . also i want to say that at the age of studing students should do study only they shoukld not be involved in any of the other activity but if they are interested so nthey can do foir their mind freshning"
