"Nowadays health care is a very important topic. Has countries which offer greats health care programs and others that are only private and expensive. \nBut I dont think that just pay more for health will be the best solution for the unhealthy lifestyles of the population. \nUnited States for example has a such unhealthy lifestyle even the health treatments there are just private and you have to pay a lot for it.
