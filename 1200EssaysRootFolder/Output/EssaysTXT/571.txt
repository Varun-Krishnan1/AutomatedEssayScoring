"Nowadays world is controlled and runned by government and strong institutions they can introduce new changes, that can steer the destiny of many and affect there life. While individuals can work on the change, they can try to change the society but it takes time for that change to get into effect. A government or large institutions are basically a group of people working towards the same goal, working behind the same ideology. This essay will argue about the changes that an individual or institution can bring in the society and which one of them is more effective in bringing these changes.\n\nThere has been a saying, If any person is working on a particular goal then there is a chance that he will fail many times, before even achieving the goal. But if he try hard enough he can achieve it. The question is if that goal is big enough like changing the society. Can he do it? And how many tries will it take to even achieve that goal? The answer is it's not easy, nothing in life is. But that's the beauty of life . There is a chance that his goal may come true and there is also a chance that it may not. So we can't be sure that he can actually achieve the goal of changing the society.\n\nOn the other hand, if any organization is working on the same goal of bringing the change or introducing new thing. Then there is a certainty, that the particular change will come for example: If the concept of digital india, was only a dream of a particular individual then there may have been a chance that particular dream may not even come true. But when this dream is supported by various organization there is a change. Maybe, at some time in the future we can even hope to achieve it, it will take time but it will come true. \n\nSo the answer is change doesn't matter how big or small it is, will come true if backed up by a group of people. But same cannot be said about a change that is supported by only a particular individual."
