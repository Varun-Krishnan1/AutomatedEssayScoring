"People who are friends talk to each other and spend time together. They trust one another and also help each other when they are in trouble or are hurt. Friends are people that can be looked up to and trusted. Friends usually have similar interests. A friend is one who admires another person.\n\nThe strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very strong, they are called best friends."
