"The older you get, the more life experience you gain, which is invaluable for leadership. You learn what's important, how to handle conflict, how to prioritize, and more. \n      Age gives you perspective on things that happened in your past. It's hard to put yourself in others' shoes if you've never been in theirs. Old age brings wisdom and knowledge from failures."
