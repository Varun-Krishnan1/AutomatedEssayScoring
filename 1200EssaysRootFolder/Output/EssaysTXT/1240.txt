This occurs because fast food tends to contain many calories and a high fat content. Sweet treats and drinks also often contain excess calories because of their sugar content. These excess calories cause people to gain weight, contributing to obesity.\nSFGate points out that junk food also contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The high fat content of this food clogs the arteries, increasing the risk of strokes and heart attacks. The high amount of sodium in some junk food raises blood pressure, making it more difficult for blood to flow.\nTooth decay is yet another problem associated with junk food, SFGate says. The sugar in sodas and other sweet beverages allows bacteria to produce acid that ruins teeth enamel.\nSFGate advises consumers to pick the healthiest fast foods, avoid fatty fries and other deep-fried food, and eat less."
