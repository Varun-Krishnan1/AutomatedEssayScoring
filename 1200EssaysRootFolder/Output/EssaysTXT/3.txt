"Gone are the days when older people were seemed to be ideal for leading an organization. But, now it has become an outmoded fashion as young leadership has proved their worth. Some people, therefore, believe that organizations should pave the way for young leadership. To my way of thinking, leadership has no business with age. So, if a young man deserve the leadership, he should be rewarded it.\n\nFor a start, leadership knows no age as it is an inborn trait. Leaders are the individuals who have innate ability to encourage others to realize their real potential, make people confident, and invoke the sense of responsibility. Most importantly, leaders possess the attitude that they want to be in the front of others. They tend to confront challenges and are ready to face any bitter experience. Another key thing to remember is that the leaders have the intrinsic acumen that they can think promptly and can make good judgment without experience or beyond their age. Thus, age does not matter for preferring leadership.\n\nIn addition, the era we live in is the epoch of technology. Modern technology prevails in each and every workplace around the world. In this technology-driven workplace, young leadership can streamline an organization comparing to their counterpart. This is because, youngsters are usually tech-savvy, and they are more comfort with the technology than the older generation. So, young people, in this era of technology, are only able to contemplate a clear vision of how an organization will develop in the coming future."
