One nice sunny day I was traped in a doctors office with no air conditioning. this doctor's office had @NUM1 chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already cramed in the room with about @NUM2 people for @NUM3 minutes. I was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. Sweat dripped of of my face on to my black @PERSON1 short-@CAPS1 shirt. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience. I know if I was going to get mad even more, it wouldnt help or make the time faster. Then all of a sudden, "creeeeeck," the door opened. A tall white woman with green schrubs on said, "@CAPS2."
