I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said." @CAPS1 get on another ride then". We already tried the other rides," my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn't desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they're holding you up, but it's the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don't shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don't think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you'll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.
