ou know that life is so much harder when you don't have the patients. If you don't then I'm going to tell you why. There was a time that found out I was going to @LOCATION1 now that's the good part but when I ask "how are we getting there?" we had to fly and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient and I thought I didn't have enough patients to fly to @LOCATION1. Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn't want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my sences and I start out it was why easier to wait and the bus eventaly showed up and I already felt way better
