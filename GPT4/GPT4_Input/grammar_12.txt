Essay 228:
Everyone has their own superheros,and I am not an exeption.Some of them like Captain America,while others may like Spiderman.However,I like Harry Potter best.So,today I will introduce my favourite superhero--Harry Potter to you.
Firstly,I would like to say that Harry Potter has a normal apperance,but not normal when he has the scar.It was made by Lord Voldemort--the most dark wizard for all the time.When Harry was one year old,Voldemort came to Harry's house to catch their parents--James Potter and Lily Potter.Although both of his parents died in that attack,surprisingly,he survived from it.And Voldemort goes away,but leave him with a scar of the Killing Curse.So when wizards see a scar on someone's forehead,they will know that he is Harry.But exept for his scar,he just wear a pair of old glasses and he has two big blue eyes.
Harry Potter,as we all know,learn magic at Hogwarts.But besides his great magic skills,he really has a good braveness.As most of students didn't stands out for the justice,he does.However,when Hogwarts is in great danger,he and his friends are the only who stands out.
I actually really admire Harry's professional magic skills.As a child,I really want to have the special power so that I could be the strongest at class.But when I get older and older,I found that Harry Potter has other skills we can learn from.For example,as I just wrote,he has a good braveness.And he also has the skill to never give up,although you are in a great danger and ther are no help.These are all we can learn from him.
That is all about my favourite superhero--Harry Potter.If you never see this movie,give it a try! I am sure that you would be amazed about him!
