Essay 1:
The other night I fell into a very deep sleep.  I know this because I didn't wake up until a lion was about to eat me alive!

Let me tell you about it ... My brother and I had decided to get on a train and go to the zoo.  It was a beautiful morning of the school holidays, and Mum and Dad had both gone to work.  Now that we are both teenagers, they let us stay home without a babysitter but we knew we were being naughty to take a train into the city.  But the day was too good to waste sitting around at home.

We had to catch a train and then a tram, but we made it by lunchtime.  After paying the entrance fee, we made our way to the lions' den because both my brother and I like the lions the most.  Usually when we have seen them they are all sleepy and not walking around, but today when we got there they were all up and about.  A crowd was gathering around their enclosure as one lion was getting quite restless and started charging towards the fence.  Cam and I pushed our way to the front just as the lion dived at the fence once more.  This time, the fence gave way and the lion was landing on top of us.  I screamed and grabbed Cam's arm as we fell to the ground under the weight of the lion.  As I looked up in horror, the lion was opening up his mouth to take us both for dinner .....

And that's when I woke up!  I have never been so relieved in all my life to wake up and find that it was still night time and I was alone in my bedroom.  It wasn't exactly a 'Sweet Dream', but we could have been a sweet main course for the runaway lion that afternoon!

If I knew a famous person was going to visit my home, firstly I would get in the industrial cleaners. The most famous person that I would love to visit would be the gorgeous Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is wonderful at his craft and extremely handsome. He is tall, has medium coloured hair, sprinkled with grey and is very sophisticated! I would love to discuuss his history in the theatre, on screen and his dancing. He was a dancer before he embarked on his acting career and I would ask him what prompted the move from dancing to acting.
There wouldn't be much to show him in my tiny house, but I would offer him a long glass of wine in the garden.

Essay 9:
I think the strangest animal I have every seen is a squid.  It swims in the ocean and is closely related to the octopus.  Both have eight legs, but the squid also has two long tentacles that they use to catch their food and put big chunks straight into their mouth.  

The squid is such an unusual looking animal - it almost looks prehistoric.  It's extremely ugly, with two big eyes close to it's legs.  It has a couple of fins at the top of it's head as well, which helps propel it through the water.  I don't think they are dangerous, but I'd be pretty scared if I came across one in the water.  Squids can actually grow up to 20 metres long, but most are much smaller.

I think the best part of a squid is eating it!  I really love calamari - lightly battered, fried, and served with aioli.  Yum!  Imagine how much calamari you could get from a 20 metre long squid!

In the dream I was in a huge and beautiful castle, I ate ice cream and played in the garden. In my dream my sister, mom, pets, dad and aunt is in there.

When I first took a bite suddenly I woke up feeling confused i thought I was eating lunch in the morning.

Essay 16:
One of the reasons that plastic should be banned at our school is because plastic bags have become a hazard for all living creatures, it takes hundreds of years to decompose. This is also one of the biggest polluters of the ocean. Millions of animals are killed by plastic every year because most of the plastic we use ends up in landfills or the ocean, the plastic takes a very long time to decompose because it is man made and not natrually produced in nature. There are only a few species of animals that can decopose the plastic but there is already 8 billion tons of plastic in the ocean and on land. Humans make 10 million pecies of plastic every day and if we do not stop using plastic there would be mass extinction of animals on the planet in a short amount of time. Another reason for our school to ban plasic is because most plastics are non renewable and contribute to climate change. Climate change is the change in tempratures and weather around the world. climate change destroys the places the animals live and therefore the animals will have nowhere left to live. Reducing the use of plastic or just not using it at all, will greatly benefit the world be lowering the CO2 emissions and plastic would not end up in the ocean and the land we live on.

Essay 17:
I heard somebody knocking on the door softly. Without hesitation, I immediately opened the door and a woman stood in front of me. She was gorgeous, with black shades on and her blonde hair was tied as a bun. She also applied red lipstick very carefully as none of them was out of the border of her lip. The woman, facing in front of me was wearing a black dress, with cotton-like materials stuck onto her dress. She slipped on a pair of platform shoes which made her whole outfit spectacular.  Due to her dressing up beautifully, I assert that she would be a famous person. After all that prediction I made, I greeted her,' Salutations. You're looking fantastic today, but what brings you here?'. 'I'm just curious of how the interior of your house will look like as the outside of that is magnificent!', she replied. At first sight, I predicted that she would be a cold person but turned out that I was wrong the whole time. I let her into my house and served her a cup of tea. I let her walk wherever she wanted to and I introduced them all. Soon, she marched up the stairs first where my room was, and pleaded to chat. The mysterious woman sat on my cozy seat and started to have a glance at my room. A while later she exclaimed how lovely my room was and chatted about fashion design. Soon enough, she reminded me of a celebrity who was into fashion design and had been in several films. I questioned her if she was the one and got a reply as so,' Looks like you've struck gold today! It was a pleasure meeting you.' I was fluttered and she really was the one. She marched back to the door and her walking was the same as in the movies. 

Essay 18:
My favorite superhero is my dad. My dad looks ordinary from the outside -- short hair, a beard, and wearing a pair of glasses that has a thick black border. Mostly my dad will wear casually with a t-shirt and casual pants. However, not judging from the outside of his, he is in love in lending a hand to people, which I thought of as a special skill. A lot of people like helping others, but this is not the case in regards to my dad. One time, my dad and I went for a stroll on the beach, which is our favorite thing to do during weekends. While we were walking, a group of kids were hanging out on the shore when one of them got stung by a jellyfish and got grabbed away towards the sea. My dad immediately ran towards the child without hesitation with clothes on and pulled him back onto the shore. The child was badly hurt and my dad asked one of the staff for help. From my dad, I know that superheroes don't always wear a cape. Although my dad is ordinary, he has a passion in helping others, whom I admire. I learned that helping others in the community can not only make them feel grateful, but can also make me feel delighted as I just made a person's day. My favorite superhero, my dad.

Essay 19:
Dear Jeremy,


I once had a dream about me being Cristiano Ronaldo running across the field. 


I was speeding towards the ball when the enemy let out an annoying leg and rolled it away from my sight. I was a bit startled and couldn't react for a split second. When I started to run again towards the football, I realized Bruno Fernandes was closer and already got the ball before I did. My hair on my hands stood up and I was starting to wonder if we would lose this match when I heard the ball hurtle towards the goal. I  but was immediatly caught by the goalkeeper standing in front of it. He rolled the football to one of my enemies but this time I was the one who gave the annoying leg and got it. Then I saw that I was very close to the ball and shot the ball. WHOOSH! The ball flew past the keeper and into the net. The crowd cheered and my teammates took me high in the air and started tossing me around. But then they didn't catch me in time and the secend I knew... THUMP! I landed headed first on the ground and suddenly I opened my eyes and discovered myself lying on my cozy bed in my nice house. I was glad I didn't really fell on the ground head first but also a bit sad as I always wanted to be a famous footballer like Cristiano Ronaldo, and that is my dream. Can you tell me a dream of yours?

The strangest animal I have ever seen.
It has the shape of a worm, but it's tilted aside, looking like it's standing. It has the color of white along with some stripes on its back. Wherever I go to zoos, there is always a pool of mud in which muddy animals live, for example frogs. However, there are always a couple of holes in the mud which I found fascinating. When I had a closer look at it, a white shaped creature just appeared. It immediately stick out of the mud and the following 'worms' also sticked out of the mud. It's strange for me as not only does it look like a worm, but it also stands up as if it has legs. Whenever people are near them, they become scared and right away, they go back into the hole again. They stick in and out occasionally and I still don't know why they have this kind of habit. I wonder, how do they eat and how can they stay in the hole for the rest of their lives?

Essay 24:
Do you guys realise the damage that is being done by simply the use of plastic bags? Don't get me wrong, it definetly makes life a lot easier, but recent study has shown that the amount of plastic use has increased by a drastic rate and is and the ocean is becoming more of a place to dump plastic rather than an actual habitat for sea animals to live in. If fact, you don't need a study to show you this, just look at the internet, or possibly even your own beach, because this problem is a global issue, meaning that everyone will be affected. Some people may be more vulnerable than others but it will affect everyone no matter what. The best solution to this problem is to begin now, the sooner we act, the easier it will be to fix this issue before it becomes a bigger problem, and one of the best ways to do it is by beginning to educate young children to be more environmentally friendly. Passing it on to future generations is important because this problem won't be fixed in a lifetime, and I doubt that it will be fixed in many other generations to come, but beginning now to teach our children how to live a more sustainable life for the world by eliminate plastic use in schools to ensure that the progress has begun, because it's one thing to cause a catastrophic problem... But it's another thing to make it irreversible.

Essay 30:
The use of plastic bags is destroying the planet. For many decades people have used plastic bags all around the world and it has become a daily essential. Its main purpose is to carry your groceries when you go shopping, but most people don't know the terrors of using a plastic bag. There are 3 main reasons why plastic bags should be banned at our school. The first is that it takes many years for any plastic to decompose. secondly, when producing plastic emits a lot of carbon dioxide. Thirdly, it's causing harm to wildlife and putting species in threat.

Plastic bags take many years to decompose which is the major cause of environmental damage. Plastic bags release toxic substances that'll affect the soil when they perish under the sunlight. This could lead to many plants and trees dying and not being able to grow because of the substance that is ruining the soil. Since plastic bags take a long time to decompose, humans found the best way to get rid of plastic was to burn it. At first, this seems like an excellent idea but burning the plastic will lead to the toxic substance being released into the air and cause air pollution. 

When producing plastic bags it emits a small amount of carbon dioxide but since human consumption involves mostly plastic, million tons of plastic are being produced every year, which results in a small amount of carbon dioxide emitting a large amount. As a result of this large amount of carbon dioxide, the earth's temperature is getting warmer, which leads to ice caps in the arctic melting and large floods can be seen all around the world. Millions of people were displaced out of their homes due to the floods and some don't have a place to stay anymore.

Plastic bags are also causing harm to the wildlife and putting animals endangered. Another solution that humans had found to dispose of their plastics is to dump them into the ocean or forests. Since much plastic waste was dumped into the ocean and the wildlife, many animals would either think it's food or gets trapped by the garbage and suffocate. Since plastic takes many years to decompose eating it won't decompose in your body which led to millions of animals dying and putting them endangered.

Therefore we should ban using plastic bags at our schools to prevent endangering the planet and the wildlife from our demand for human consumption. We should all start reducing are use for plastics in general to help save the planet.

 

Essay 31:
Dear school

Pollution and global warming are some of the most really serious issues in the world right now, what causes it, is plastics. But that's is not the main reason pollution happens, unresponsible people who threw that plastic product out the nature, they threw it into the ocean, the streets, and basically everywhere they go. You might think pollution and global warming are nothing, and that will happen years later, but if we keep on doing this, especially the adults, then their children and kids will look up to them, repeat what their parents did and that will speed up the process causing those issues to happen sooner. I love my school, our school, I always wanted the best for us, wanted us to be the best. So I think, we should really ban plastic bags, I don't think this is a big deal, because we can replace them with something else, like a canvas bag for example, but don't worry, plastic products surrounding our classroom shouldn't be a ban, those are plastics that we can reuse and won't release them out to the environment. But plastic products in our cafeteria should be a ban, because those are items we won't reuse, like a plastic water bottle, have you ever wondered how long it takes for a plastic water bottle to fully decompose? 450 years, for a 500ml plastic water bottle, that's insane, don't you think? A few supermarkets in some countries have banned plastic bags, even some schools have also done it, so why can't we achieve that goal too? I really wish you take my message seriously, this is just my opinion, I really want the best for our school so that's why I wrote and sent you guys this message because usually, I won't be writing letters to the school community if a problem is not that serious. Thank you for taking time out and reading my words.

Essay 35:
 Plastic bags are very important in our daily lives. A lot of people all over the world have been relying heavily on plastic bags, they would rather buy a shopping bag instead of bringing their own. Owners of supermarkets from different parts of the world have banned plastic bags in their own supermarket as they know the terrible aftermath of using plastic bags. Seeing supermarkets banning plastic bags, I suggest perhaps we could follow their lead and ban the use of plastic bags in our school. 
  Firstly, plastic bags take up a lot of time to decompose. Most people would try to burn plastic bags, but it is very hard to completely break it down. It is one of the hardest things to burn down, according to experts. We as students often use plastic bags, we probably dispose around 3 plastic bags once a week, those plastic bags will still be around in 2070! 
  Secondly, plastic bags are extremely dangerous to marine animals. Addressing the amount of plastic bags we use in our daily lives, there were at least 10 plastic bags being littered around, and you might never know where they might end up. It might end up in the ocean or even in your backyard! The problem is that most plastic bags end up in the ocean. As plastic bags are very light, they might end up in the ocean. There are multiple news of sea turtle eating up plastic bags because they think the plastic bags are jellyfish. Besides this, there are a lot of news about fishes and seabirds getting caught up in plastic. This have caused a lot of animals to die, and seriously disturbing marine life. 
  The extreme usage of plastic bags is a very important problem in the world. Even though they are more cons than pros, people are still not addressing this problem. In order to reduce the amount of plastic bags, I highly recommend the ban of plastic bags in our school. This could help the pollution by a large margin. 

Essay 36:
Bags are convenient  in our daily lives, but some types can cause a lot of harm that we do not mean to. Plastic bags are the most common type of bags made globally, though they do come in cheap prices, they  also cause extereme problems at the same time. In order to produce plastic, an enormous amount of energy and resources is needed; this causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. Although plastic could be recycled, recycling plastic has not been efficient- only about nine percent of plastic ever produces haas been recycles. Marine animals are also victims of plastic, it is harming them and ecosystems of many marine biomes and it's hazardous to human health. Our plastic consumption is directly affecting marine life in the ocean including fish, which is a main source of food for huamns as well.
Additionally, most plastics are single- use. This inclues items like plastic bags, packagings. water bottles and straws. Plastic can take hundreds or even thousands of years to degrade and most don't biodegrade completely. Instead, they gradually break down into tiny pieces of plastic which are significantly harder to remove from the environment than the larger bottles. With all this been said, I highly encourage everyone to thoroughly consider your decisions while choosing shopping bags and to save our environment by canceling out plastic bags from our school campas!

Fellow students:

Recently, major institutions around the world have been advocated for environmental protection, calling for usage of recyclable materials. As an international citizen, I believe that we should contribute to this global movement. Therefore, I am offcially calling for the banning of plastic bag in our school for the sake of protecting the environment.

Firstly, using plastic bags causes huge burden to local trash-dealing institutions, as plastic is not biodegradable material. It generally takes more than two hundred years to degrade one plastic bag, which severely damage the soil condition and environmental resources. It is irresponsible to abuse the environment in this large extent. Also, for our posterity, they'll have to face a dark and stark environment if we continue to use these resources relentlessly.

Secondly, it will not be difficult or suffering for students to quit using plastic bags. There are several reusable meterials out there to choose. They are better in terms of quality and duration than plastic bags. Promoting these products is easy in school and will not likely to cause any major inconvenience. For example, Putney high school in the state of Vermont, US imposed a comprehensive ban on plastic bags since 2019 and the student council said that they totally accepted the policy.

In a nutshell, I suggest that our school should ban plastic bag in campus. It gives our children a better environment and is a relatively practical policy.

Essay 45:
There is a reason why the term 'Mother Earth' is getting more prevalent. As humans living on Earth, this planet has always been our one and only source of sustenance, a supply of resources that has always been there. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we try our best to maintain this sustainable relationship with Earth, however precarious it may be.

Currently, the main source of pollution has been plastic. The invention of this material is a great leap into the future for humanity, as it ensures efficient and cheap production of a plethora of different items. However, there are drawbacks. Plastic has been deemed one of the hardest materials to break down, which means that it poses a dire threat to this planet. One single piece of plastic can remain intact for thousands of years, harming eco systems and all species of flora and fauna.

The most prevalent use of plastic? Plastic bags. Yes reader, you have definitely used them before. These lightweight mass distributed bags are extremely convenient, and yet the consequences of using them stretch far into the future. Think of all these times that you took all the items out of the bag, and carelessly toss it into the bin without a second thought. Well, this bag goes from the bin to the trash collecting truck, from the truck to the landfill. Now, it either resides in that landfill for a very long time, secreting toxins into the soil; or it is burnt, releasing green house gas into the atmosphere; or it is dumped into the ocean, smothering countless sea creatures such as turtles. All this just because people wanted a cheap way to lug things around. 

Even if you don't care about harms to the environment, pollution caused by plastic bags also harms people directly. Earth is a system that is constantly circulating, which is why plastic often ends up in water supply, even in food sources. Research has shown that humans have been consuming a larger amount of plastic in the near present. This has the potential to cause a myriad of health defects, and is suspected to be a cause of some very deadly ailments that people currently suffer from. Therefore, now is definitely the time for action.

As an environmentally aware school community, we should most definitely abolish the use of plastic bags on campus. Even though school is simply a microcosm of society, it is crucial we begin here, in a facility responsible for the education of future generations, and inform people on the importance of preserving the environment, starting with the abolishment of plastic bags.

Essay 46:
In recent years, some supermarkets have banned plastic bags, and I believe that it is a good thing. Nowadays people rarely reuse or recycle plastic bags, since they aren't easy to reuse but are very cheap. However, each time a plastic bag is thrown away, they will mostly be discarded, sometimes in the ocean or burnt. Yet these actions are bad for our environment, in the ocean, there are tons of trash, killing wildlife and disturbing entire food chains. Burning them releases lots of CO2 which is a greenhouse gas, and will contribute to global warming, causing disaster in nature, melting the polar ice caps and causing rises in sea level. All of this is because of people throwing away plastic bags, and also because of cars, factories and even cows. If we do not use plastic bags, then a lot of this can be avoided. If you think that what you do or not do matters not, then you are wrong, as every little bit helps, and with enough people, it will make some difference. Therefore, I believe that we should ban plastic bags at our school, so that we can contribute to the fight against pollution, and help make the world we live on a better place.

Essay 47:
The summer weather is hot and humid. You often sweat and feel hot. In that weather, no matter when, the air conditioner is always switched on. People often go swimming or to the beach, where the breeze is cool. Also, you will want to stay at home aand enjoy the fan or air con.

Winter is cool and dry. Many people think that it is a good weather for running, or hiking because you won't feel to hot and sweat that much. In some places, there will be snow, and, one more activity will be added----playing in the snow. You can play with snow balls or build snowmans, and some people like lying in the snow, making a snow angel. You can go skiing as well, which is almost hiking but just going down.

I like winter best. It is because I don't like to waste electricity and switch on the air con that much. When I sometimes feel heated, I would just switch on the fan or just go on with the heat. If there was snow in HK, then of course I would want to go and play in the snow. My favourite activity in the snow is skiing and making a snowman, which I like doing with my brother. He is very good at building snowmans. Especially big ones. We would make the snowman as large as we can. My brother doesn't ski, he only snowboards. We like doing those side by side. So we can chat while we slide down the hill. Winter is very fun. When I go skiing, it always brings me back to the times when I was small, and also before my brother went to England. Luckily, he will come back soon and I am looking forward to doing those things in the snow again.

Summer is boring, only hot and humid, you can feel. You can't do much in Summer

Essay 48:
    Dear schoolmates, when you are reading this, I would like to invite you to recall the last time you used a plastic bag. When and why did you use it? Have you ever consider the consequences it may bring? If you can't remember, it's fine, but mainwhile, it alarms that using plastic bags has become our daily routine. We have to reverse this situation.
    Plastic, known as the greatest and the worst invention of the twenty-first century, has brought us much harm as convenience. For example, plastic products are hard to break down, every year hundreds and thousands of tons of plastic have flooded into the ocean and the land, causing irreversible pollution and harm to the ecosystem.We have seen distressing pictures online that seagulls are suffocated by plastic bags and sea turtles are wrapped up by plastic bags. What's worse is that some researches have found microplastic inside human body.
    In order to deal with the situation and slow down the spread of plastic, many countries have enacted restrictions on plastic, and we may notice that some supermarkets around us have stopped providing plastic bags. It may cause some inconvenience but it is not insurmountable. I would like to call on everyone that we should ban plastic bags at school in order to do something for the bright future of humanity as teenagers. By wielding our young minds we can change the situation in a small but strong way. We can find repacement for plastic bags, we can persuade others stop using plastic bags, and we can orgnize related zctivities. Join me and ban plastic bags at school would be a good start.

Once again, staring blankly at the TV screen, I sighed hesitantly while looking at the weather forecast. "Heavy rain with thunderstorms..." uttered the news reporter with a slight smile plastered on her pale face. As I looked around, time seemed to freeze, nothing moving at all, with the television noise echoing murderously inside my brain. Knock...knock...knock... The front door creaked as I reluctantly stood up, peeking through the door hole. Blurry movements were seen outside as I curiously open my eyes wider, seeing a figure of a towering woman waving at me.

Since nervousness was cunningly obstructing my thoughts, I steadily unlocked the door. To my surprise, the international superstar singer was standing in front of me with her glossy black bucket hat on combined with sunglasses, covering her eyes. "H-h-h-hi," I stuttered anxiously as I looked down to the floor. "Hello! Nice to meet you, I have heard all sorts of stories about you. You are a journalist right..?" she smiled sweetly while staring at me. As a response, I just stood there while obediently nodding to her question. I felt like being violently sucked inside a small, dimmed room with no escape while still showered in confusion yet exhilaration. "May you show me around your house?" the woman asked politely with her eyes freely wandering around my house. "I would love to!" I exclaimed excitedly as I led her into my office.

"Beep...beep...beep..." the alarm clock rang deafeningly as I jumped right up from the bed in horror while scanning continuously around the room. No sign of any human being... So was it all just in my imagination?

In recent years, some supermarkets across the world have banned plastic bags, and I belive our school community should follow in their footsteps. Countless research over the years has proven that pollution is one the main driving factors of climate change and plastic is one of the main contributors. Sure, plastic bags are quick and convient to use, but its impact on their enviorment is deadly; plastic takes decades, if not centuries to naturally dispose of. When we are still continuing to use plastic bags even though we are aware of the harm it does to our enviorment, we are showing that we do not care for our planet. Climate change may seem like to big of a problem for us students to tackle, but to help combat climate change, we must all do our part, no matter how small and insignificant it may seem. Banning the usage of plastic bags in our school may seem like a small step, but it is vital to slow the effects of climate change. To those wondering what we would use instead of plastic bags, do not worry, I have a solution in mind. Instead of using single-use platic bags, we could use totebags. Tote bags are not only stylish, and cheap, it is most importantly good for the enviorment since it can be reused. While banning platic bags may seem like an unnessecary change to some, climate change is too big of an issue for us to not take action immediately.

This person wore a formal dark-blue suit, he was a little bit fat, but the two big eyes and his smile made him looked friendly. It was Lang Lang, a famous pianist that I really love. He was popular, not only for his fantastic playing skills, but also for his characteristic.

I smiled to Lang Lang and guided him to my living room. When he saw the big piano standing on the floor, he walked to it and touched the keybord gently. A piece of beautiful music flew to the sky. "Your piano is really nice.", Lang Lang said. I sat down and played a famous classical music to him. He praised and taught me how to play better. I also showed him some of my favourite music and asked him to give some comment. "There are a lot of people that play Mozart's music, but how to identify which is better?", I asked Lang Lang a question, and he was like a teacher that explained to me patiently. 

Lang Lang was a guider. He impressed me a lot and I felt enjoyable to stay with a person that also love music.

As I heard footsteps ouside the door, the clock suddenly screamed. Just as I peered through the hole, the person rang the bell. I opened the door and I was shocked to see that it wasn't any ordinary delivery man, but it was BTS! I screamed to loud even my dog sprinted down the stairs to see what was going on. "OMG! Is it really BTS?!" I screamed to the top of my lungs. "Hello we are BTS! Kim namjoon, Kim Soekjin, Minyoogi, Jung hoseok, Park jimin, Kim taehyung, Jeon Jungkook and BTS!" they greated in korean which I understood because of how much korean dramas I watched. "MOM!! BTS is here!" my mom jumped down the stairs and rushed to greet BTS with a welcoming smile. "Can I take a photo with you guys? Is it fine? Feel free to take any food from our home! This home is yours!" while my mom was babbling the words out of her mouth she was stuttering since she was also a huge fan of BTS and her Bias Wrecker was Jungkook. I quickly ran to grab seven slippers for the seven members to come into our home. All of the members had wonderful and pleasant smilings ln their faces with polite manners. I was too shocked and nervous to speak to them since I would not know they would come to my home. Each of them walked into my home and I led them to the bathroom to clean their hands. After that, My mother cooked Kimbab and rice cakes for the seven members to eat. "Wow! this is delicious!" replied Namjoon. All the other members nodded their heads and agreed since it was actually really good. "So, Why did you come to our house? What has led you guys to come to our house? Its a pleasure to have you guys come you know?" said my mother. My mother's was probably feeling exited, just like me my heart was beating really quickly because I thought I would never be able to see the BTS members in real life. Jungkook shoved the whole bowl of rice cakes in his mouth and his smile was extremely wide and large which made me smile too. "Want to see my room? I am a really big fan of you guys!" I shouted across the table. "Obviously! Sure!" As they entered my room they were gasping and in shock but in a happy way. "I bought many albums and merches from you guys! I got the hoodie, the bags, the acessories and even the music albums from you guys! look at the walls! I even stuck every single member on the wall." I guided them through my room. "Wow this is amazing. You are so kind hearted and I hope that we can bring happiness and joy to you and your family! Hope to see you guys again! Bye!" they bowed down and walked out of hour home with their things.

I also admire him because he saved a lot of people in the movie and books. The special skills that captain America have is that he can ran super fast and his shield is a weapon and an armour to defence and attac. He is a superhero because in this movie Marvel, there was a good and helpful team member of fighters. He has this really cool armour. his armour's colour is blue and red. his helmet is an oval shape. His shield is the best thing out of the armour. In the middle of the shield is a red star and around it is red and blue stripes. And when he threw his shield away, the shield would come back to him. He superpower is mainly his shield. When he misses the enemy he can always try hiting the enemy again until he gets the enemy. I believe he was the captain of his team. In his team, everyone was a superhero and had good superpower, but I think Captain America is the best superhero in the superhero history. And when trouble comes, he is always there to help.

Hello everyone,I'm writing to persuade you to stop using plastic bags.
As we all know,plastic bags are really harmful to the environment.They are also called"white pollution".In recent years,some supermarkets have banned plastic bags.In my opinion,we should also stop using them.Plastic bags have been banned in China for over 5 years,which makes the air much better than before.Before this ban came out,I can receive more than 5 plastic bags a day!Some people think giving customers plastic bags for free shows their good service.Luckily,the president made a ban and stop this strange think.
Plastic bags are made from factories and made by plastic.Plastic is a kind of chemistric product,which requires a lot of energy.We are actually short for energy now,so stop using plastic bags will be a good choice to save energy.Instead of using plastic bags,we can use backpacks or cloth bags which can be used fore more than one time.
Should plastic bags be baned in our school?My opinion is,YES.If you agree with me,please stop using them.Saving our planet requires all of your effort.Thank you!

Hua Chen Yu is a Chinese and he is a male idol, specially focus on singing and a small part of acting. He is about 176 cm high and is having a good appearance in my aesthetic standard. He was famous because he has a great talen in music and was a teenager musician. He became popular when he was very young by both of his appearance and talent. He created and published lots of popular music to different age of people, and became more famous by participating in variety shows.

I will communicate with hime just like a friend, for not giving too. much pressure between us.

Hello, today I'm going to talk about what if a famous person or celebrity comes to my home. So if some celebrity like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is a really talented soccer player comes to my house, I would propably freak out, because the odds of this happening is extremely slim. Cristiano Ronaldo is really tall (taller than my tallest family member which is my dad), he is more than 35 years old now but he still looks very young to be honest. If he ever comes to my home (which he probably never will), I would instantly ask for an autograph and his signature, like any other fan if they ever encountered him, after that though, I would ask him about his life as a extremely famous celebrity. After all the questions are done, I would show him around the whole house, it won't take even half a hour as my house is miniscule compared to his luxury mansion. Everything done, right? No, what I'm doing next might not be the best decision, but I would gift him something super valueble, like a computer or jewellery, after that's done, I would wave goodbye to him and he swiftly leaves. That's all, thank you for reading.

Essay 79:
Nowadays, the plastic bags become more and more useful in people's life. Use the plastic bag to carry the things you just bought from the supermarket is very convenient. But if too many people use plastic bags to carry the things, there will be a lot of waste plastic bags. So I think we should ban the plastic bags in our school.
The first reason is that waste plastic bags is harm to the environment. Because the plastic cannot be recycled, and it is a non degradable waste type. So if we produce and use the plastic bags, they amount of the waste plastic bags cannot be reduced, and if we just dig a hole and put the waste bags in, it will be a very seriou pollution. We cannot recycle the waste plastic bags, so we can olny reuse and reduce the plastic bags. Ban the plastic bags can reduce the amount of the waste bags, and it also can let the students to reuse the bags which they used before. So I think that ban the plastic bags will be a great policy.
Also, buy a new plastic bag for each time is going to waste a lot of money. For example, buy one plastic bag need 5 cents, that isn't too much. But if you buy a plastic bag every day, you will use 150 cents in one month. For a year, you will use 1825 cents. But if you buy a reusable woven bag, you can use it for a long period. So you can save a lot of money. So I think ban the plastic bags can help the students to build a habit what is saving money. That is good for the students working career.
To conclude, I think that to ban the plastic bags will have a lot of advantage.

Essay 80:
  Plastic bags, mostly used in supermarkets have been banned from supermarkets in a number of countries. The most common reason is to be more eco-friendly and to produce less waste, and also to protect the animals such as turtles as they might confuse plastic bags for food. Yet our school hasn't acknowledge the negative impact plastic bags could have in school.
  FIrstly, allowing plastic bags could destroy lives of some sea anmals. As you all might know, animals such as turtles and dolphines eat jelly fish, which is mostly transparent. The dolphines and turtles might confuse plastic bags that have been thrown into the sea by humans as jelly fishes. That could make them sufficate or seriously hurt them, which may lead dolphines to extinct. Plastic bags could also destroy homes of sea animals that live on seabeds  by covering the seabed with live-threatening plastic bags.
  Secondly, younger students might play with plastic bags and accindentally hurt other students with plastic bags. Almost every children have no intention of harming other people, matter of fact they even love to interact with their peers and play with each others. But they might not know what they should play with and what they shouldn't play with. Younger students might think that playing with plastic bags and making it a hat funny, some students might also think that putting a plastic bag on their head funny. But they have no idea that it could possibly sufficate other classmates without the intention of doing so, which could cause serious injuries and even death.
  Thirdly, there will be alot of waste produced by both students and teachers. Although plastic bags are very convenient, it carries a lot of disadvantages, such as it is a one time use item. Most people think that it would be way faster to through plastic bags in normal rubbish bins rather than recycling bins, which could effect the environment by producing a lot of waste and polluting the air as the bags are being burnt when sent to the wasteland. It could also harm the enviroment if some people litter
  In conclution, I think that school should ban plastic bags and heavily recommend everyone in the school to use bags that can be used more than once. Not only can that save the enviroment and animals, it could also save the energy spent on recycling the plastic bags.

Through the past years, calls to ban plastic bags have arose among society, due to worldwide concerns on the topic of global warming and pollution of the earth, as an act to reduce environmental pollution, stopping environmental declination at its tracks. It is now suggested that plastic bags should be banned at school, which not only reduces waste, but also nurtures students' environmental conciousness and reduces massive usage of plastic products.

Firstly, banning plastic bags at school reduces waste, which is a main component of environmental protection. As plastic bags cannot be reused, they contribute to millions of tons of garbage in the world every year. Due to the unbiodegrable feature of plastic, they cause immense pollution to the environment, destroying lands and oceans. With the vast amount of students in school, the policy of banning plastic bag usage may lead to reduction of large amounts of plastic waste, thereby slowing down environmental pollution and the consequences of such, for example global warming or habitat loss of animals.

Secondly, environmental consciousness of students may be built up. By banning plastic bags at school, students may earn of actions of mankind to try to protect the environment. The ban exists in supermarkets in multiple countries, and the school trying such a policy may nourish students' interest in environmental protection, and information of the threats the world is facing can be introduced to students, as components of the plastic bag ban policy, giving students an insight of the centre of global attention, which may have large impact in the following years. Reduction of plastic usage may also help them develop a habit of reducing waste, and using reusable containers instead of plastic bags.

Thirdly, the usage of plastic bags in school is rather unnecessary, thus would not lead to too much discomfort amongst students. Main activities of students at school are usually learning in class or joining extra-curricular activities, both of which doesn't include using plastic. As students in school usually eat out or in the cafeteria, reusable containers or utensils are used. Fabric bags are commonly used to hold books or learning material, as examples of how plastic bags are completely uninvolved. Therefore, it is held that banning of plastic bags in school would not lead to unconvenience.

All in all, by weighing both environmental considerations and necessity of plastic bags in the school, it is concluded that plastic bags are unnecessary, and the ban would help students develop environmental interest and concerns, therefore it is suggested for plastic bags to be banned at our school.

Everybody has got a superhero, and so do I...

Through electronics, people admire superheroes for saving villages, defeating villains, and being powerful but warmhearted. Heroes and normal citizens would be stereotyped in a variety of ways, creating a distant difference between one another. Yet, as a famous saying: "not every superhero wear capes", this has altered my biased perspective about heroes entirely. 

She, my life-long role model, has been with me throughout my childhood till now, every single painful situation, like a keen blade stabbing my body murderously with no mercy, and every uplifting moment. With every tear streaming down my eyes, like a river casually flowing down, and each pleasant smile that has been plastered up against my face, she has always been around, carefully advising considerable comments. Also, every single word she peacefully uttered is deeply cherished and remembered wholeheartedly in my hopeless soul.

She saved my life, my hero...

 

Essay 84:
  Chocolate. A sweet created with coco and sugar. Although it might seem like nothing more that a simple sweet that everyone loves, it can a lot of people that don't have enough income to even support themselves. Here are a few reasons why i should be the winner.
  Firstly, I will give out as much chocolate i can to anyone who might need it. A lot of people who don't have a sufficient income might not be able to feed themselves or their families. I can help them by giving the chocolate out in different types of food. You might be a bit confused but hear me out. I can turn the chocolate into different food such as spliting the chocolate into small pieces and mixing them with dough, creating chocolate crackers. I can also turn the chocolate into chocolate drinks by melting the chocolate and adding a bit of water in order to compensate the sweetness. All of the ideas above are treated with maximum hygiene. That will help a lot of people as they can have food to eat and have a lower chance of starving and getting sick.
  Secondly, it could help schools by providing the teachers with chocolate snacks instead of needing the teacher to buy it themselves. As all of you know, there are a lot of teachers out there who love to treat students with snacks if they score well in tests or do good in class. The teachers would need to buy the snacks themselves as the school isn't providing them with snacks to gift students. But if the chocolate were in my hands, i would give a plenty amount of chocolate to any teachers who would want to give their students treats if they wanted to. It can also reduce the financial stress of teachers who have lower income that want to give students a treat or two.
  That is about it for why i should be the winner. There are alot of positive things that could happen if i were the winner. And I really hope that I can be the winner as I had always wanted to help people who are in need. Thank you!

  "Knockknock!" I immediately ran to the front door. Who is it? I thought. When I opened the door, my heart almost missed a beat, my eyes could have fallen out anytime by now. It was Soman Chainani, my favourite arthor of my favourite book - The School for Good and Evil! He looked like a film star in my eyes. His book was so famous around the world. I loved his book because it has so many clif hangers and you would never guess what happened next. It was a thrilling, majestic fantasy story. The book there was 7 books. Including The School for Good and Evil 1-6 and The Ever Never Handbook and more! I was so surprised he came. Then I, of course led him to the living room and found it perfectly dusted. I served him coffee with a gingerbread biscut and asked for his autograph. Oh how lucky I am. He asked me if I wanted to know any of thing to ask about the book he wrote.

If I could choose a famous person that could visit me I would choose Andy Griffiths. Why did i choose him? Because I have admired his books, he is the creator of  "The 13-Storey Treehouse." I have always loved his books since I was a child, about 8 or 9. He even came to my school once, and I got a signed copy of his "The 117-Storey Treehouse". 
  What does Andy look like? He has short black hair, just like in the book. He is famous because he is the author of many children's books including like I said before, The Storey Treehouse's series. He and his friend, Terry Denton, and his wife, Jill Griffiths made the amazing series of The Storey Treehouse.
   What would I say to him? Well I would say I am a big fan of his books, and I love his sense of humor in his books. There are just many things I could say to him, including questions, "How long does it take to make a Storey Treehouse book?" Or 'Do you enjoy writing for young kids?" and many more.
  I would show them my collection of their books, and I would also show them my dog because I think Andy will like him. Maybe I would even show him my room! My room is very neat and tidy (in my opinion), and my bed is really comfy!

Dear Friend,

  I had a weird dream and it brought me memories, and I hope I could share it to you, 
 Last night, I was in a dream where I was in the city we used to live in. I went though the beaches and all the shops, the city was so lovely. It brings me memories about our childhood, the playgrounds that we played in, the arcade that we used to spend hours in, and how can I forget the ice cream shop. But when I was in the dream, no one could see me, I was wandering around, everything felt so real. I was amazed, I was speechless. So, for the rest of my dream I traveled across the whole city, and at one point I swear I could see our old school. It brings me nostalgia, and made it made my day. When I woke up, I was happy for the entire day. Oh also, the dream reminded me of something, we haven't talked in a while, should we meet up? I think it would be awesome!

Plastic Bags Should Be Banned

One little move that we make will impact this world big! All we have to do is to ban plastic bags, because it is harmful to the environment, wasting of money, and can be replaced. 
Plastics are harmful to the environment. plastics are not recyclable, as we can see, usually plastics are laying around on the floor, on the street, in the ocean, it's everywhere except in the garbage can. What happens next is the news about hurting the animals in the ocean or the Earth is going to be disappeared because people are not throwing the plastics in the garbage can. So instead of seeing plastics everywhere in the school and trying to figure out who it was, plastics should be banned.
Plastics are a waste of money. Even plastic bags are often used, but normally it's used because people wanted to take away food or they couldn't finish the food. Instead of telling people to stop wasting their food, the school should just ban plastic bag so that they couldn't keep the food. The money that is used to buy plastic can be added to the school supplies and to the charity. 
Plastic bags could be replaced by a lot of other things. Plastics could be shown everywhere but they can also be replaced by other things. For example, plastic spoons can be replaced by wood spoons, plastic straws can be replaced by paper straws, and plastic bags can be replaced by fabric bags. 
In conclusion, plastic bags should be banned in school. Because it is harmful and not recyclable, wasting time and money, and it could easily be replaced by other things. Nowadays, more supermarkets are starting to ban plastic bags, and more restaurants are stopping using plastic straws and to-go bags, our school should do something like that, too!

One day when I went to the zoo with my family, I saw an animal that looked very strange, it had a mouth like a duck and the body was dark brown and some part it brown like the legs. It has four legs or whatever they are, they had sharp pointy things on them at the end of each leg which is it's claws to protect itself and to get food to eat. The animal's name was called the Platapus. It was a native Australian animal which means it was first found in Australia. The animal lives in water. I don't believe that the animal live in salt water but it rather lives in fresh water, like lakes and river. There used to be a lot of them in Australia but now they are named as indangered species. In the zoo I saw it in a tank as in a tank for animals not the tanks they use in the war. I think the strange thing about them is that they have a mouth like a duck but have a body that does not look like a duck. They also have the strange claws to protect and attack. I think that is the most strange thing about the Platapus. But there is still many other strange thing about them like, why is their mouth so long and why is it the colours that it is on their body.

Nowadays, there has been an increasing trend of awareness towards outer-space species, which means there has also been an decreasing attention towards animals or living creatures on earth. I will be discusing strangest animal I have seen-kangaroos

To initiate with, the first time I saw kangaroos was on TV. they have the heads that is similar to deers but without horns. The strangest part of their body is 'sleeping bag' that is grown on their stomach part. They also have muscular legs which helps them with their movements. Secondly, most kangaroos habitats' are in  Australia, the 'down under' with strong beam from the sun. Thus the colour of their fur looks light brown. Lastly, in comparison with other animals, kangaroos not only have their 'pocket' on their body, but also have strange techniques of combat, similar to boxing.

As a conclusion, a strange animal are needed to be different, whether it be appearence or the way they fight. From my perspective, kangaroos can verify those factors I just mentioned.

Essay 106:
Yesterday was the best day of my life! I was just about to leave for my piano lesson when I saw a man sitting down on our living room couch. I couldn't really tell who he was at first because all i could see was the back of his head. He had short, dark hair.  He was very well dressed. He was wearing a brown leathered jacket over a white T-shirt.  I think he could sense my presence because right when I was examining him, he turned his head around to look at me. My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe my eyes. I never thought this day would come. I pinched myself a couple of times. It was Tom Holland! My all time favourite movie star. He plays the character spiderman. My number one super hero. Just then, my brother came out of the kitchen with a couple of drinks. My brother noticed how confused I looked and instantly introduced me to Tom Holland and told him that I was his biggest fan. I was embarassed but also thrilled at the same time. Tom greeted me with a warm smile. I immediately felt butterflies in my stomach. I told him I had already watched every single one of his movies at least three times. Then I started to ask him questions about his experience filming the latest spiderman movie. He was a very friendly and fun person to talk to. I enjoyed every second of our conversation. I finally decided to show Tom my favourite part of the house: my room. Reason being, every corner of my room is covered with posters of spiderman. And I also

In our world today plastic bags have been an important product for every human being on the planet. It is easy to produce, cost cheap, and have a variety of uses, but nothing is perfect so do plastic bags. It is an important factor causing global warming and pollution. Many supermarkets and countries around the world have banned plastic bags because of their damage to the environment. So I think our school should also apply this ban plastic bags. The first reason for this is that it could harm the school environment. School enviroment is a big part of not only the school but also the students, student won't be able to learn with a dirty and polluted environment. No one is going to promise that the students are going to reuse the plastic bag and recycle them properly. We are really familiar with the image of plastic things especially plastic bags on the side way of the street. The second reason is that the amount of plastic being produced will increase leading to pollution. Nowadays plastic bags have been around on a lot of stuff we could have seen them wrap around food that we eat every day. So if food in the cantin uses plastic bag to wrap and for the kids to carry this would cause a lot of plastic bags being produce since students in a school nowadays is not under 1000 kids per school. In conclusion, we should ban plastic bags in the school because of two reasons. The first reason is that it could harm the school environment, and the second reason is that it could make cause pollution, since that uses increase the production of plastic bags would increases.

Essay 108:
In recent years, some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags as an action to help the environment. Plastic bags sometimes are not neccesary, such as putting enclosed food in plastic bags. This increases the number of plastic bags which can be avoided, and plastic bags cause many enironmental problems. 

First of all, plastic bags take centries to be natrually degrade, which means they take ages to be dissolved by the environment. With the pace of our uses, most of the landfills will be full in under a decade, which leads to more landfills and more unuseable spaces. Other rubbish treatment is to burn them, but burning plastic produces greenhouse gas, making the serious global warming more serious. 

Secondly, not all people are well behaving that they just throw rubbish on the street or into the ocean. If they throw plastic bags on the, the area starts to get dirty, and this will increase the workload of cleaners. If they throw into the ocean, marin lifes may treat plastic bags as food, and they may eat them and causes diseaes due to their stomach full of plastic bags. They may also get trapped in plastic bags, which greatly affect their daily life.

Therefore, I believe that plastic bags should be banned at our school to help the enivronment. Plastic bags are not essential as there are lots of alternative, for example, frabic bags, backpack, or even our hands. If students have a habit of not using plastic bags, this will lower the number of plastic bags in the world by a tiny fraction. Although it doesn't seem a lot, we should still do our best to keep our mother nature healthy, for us and the next generations.

Dear Friend,

Did you know once, I have a very interesting dream about I am the only person left in the world. So what I did was, eat everything in the store and I can even get anything I want. Even though, I can have anything I want, I was pretty lonely I have no friends to played with no one to care for you, no one to cooked for you it is just really lonely there. I can only stay where I was because there was no one to drive for me so I couldn't travel anywhere.

  There are lots of superheroes that I really admires because of their abilites, skills and experiences. But out of all of them, there is a unique superhero that I likes the most. He is called by the Caped Baldy, Saitama.
  Saitama had a special bald head. He used to explained that it was because he worked out so hard that all of his hair had gotten fewer until he was bald. Saitama has an elastic, yellow suit because it stands out and easy for him to move. He also has some red gloves and a pair of heel with the same colour as the gloves just like most of the superheroes. The main thing that every superheroes will not want to miss is a cape. Saitama has a long, cream coloured cape that reaches until his ankle which represents him. His clothes are quite colourful which made him different than others.
  Saitama has a simple skill that anyone can do it. All he needs to do in most fights is to land a single, direct punch towards his opponents. There are three different types of punch that he uses, a soft punch, medium punch, and the serious punch. He will estimate his opponents' strength and decide what punch he should use. That's also the reason why the name of the series is called One Punch Man. 
  I really admires Saitama because he is a person that is hard working. He sometimes show others repects and he is funny. I likes the way he fights because it's really cool. Just imagine you blows your opponents out by just one punch.  I have mad respects for him. 
  Saitama remains to be one of my most favourite superheroes. He has a strong punch that can send you to an another world, funny and completely stands out in an interesting way.

They're fingerprints and fingers are built so similar to humans. Koala's like to climb onto trees and stay there for a long time. Other animals cannot grip onto trees for so long that's because they so not have fingerprints and finger's like humans. Koala's have an advantage since they have such a unique and cute hand. Koal's also have two pairs of largae dark eyes which glows. They have large noise which allows them to find food and I think koala's are unique because they have figners built like humans and they are really cute. I love koala's a lot because of they're uniqueness.

Dear my friend,
I live in Hong Kong and I have been living there for 13 years. Hong Kong is a very well known and small city which tall buildings everywhere. Most people live in tall buildings. I live in an apartment in kowloon tong, Ho Man Tin. My home is on the 46 floor. My neighbores also lives in the same apartment where we get to communicate and chat with them easily since we live very close to each other. Hong Kong is different to other places since people usually live in tall buildings but the peope who live in other places live in houses and low apartments. Something I don't like about my area is that it is very small. ALl the citizens in Hong Kong are very close to each other which makes it so cramped.

Thank you. Hope you have a great time!

Sincerely, Audrey.

Banning plastic bags has been a debatable topic among the society and students. While some hold the belief that plastic is harmful to the environment and nature species, others still ignore its drawbacks. However, in order to improve human's life quality, it is crucial to take responsibility of using chemical products such as plastic bags.

First of all, plastic bags take a huge amount of time to fully disintergrate. In other words, if the bags are thrown into the ocean, they still appear there for decades. According to scientist, plastic is estimated to 450 years to be disappeared. Additionally, the mjority of the plastic bags would be dumped to the sea and ocean.

Essay 122:
  Hello everyone, a lot of you may already knew that in recent years some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags and you may wonder why, so today I'm going to talk about the harm that the plastic bags have done to our environment and why we shouldn't use it in our school.
  As we all know, after shopping in the supermarket, the shop assistant may ask you whether you need a plastic bag. I know it's very convenient at the moment, but when you arrive home you may just throw them away. At last the plastic bags will be bury under the soil. Since it's hard for the plastic bags to decompose itself, it will stay under the soil forever and cause damage to the ecosystem.
  When you are walking by the sea, except for the beautiful sea view, you may also see there are many floating plastic bags. This is what we called "White pollution". Animals living in the sea were finding out eating the plastic bags accidentally, this always lead them to death without other's help. Plastic bags have caused serious pollution to the environment of the sea.
  What will plastic bags do to our school? I believe that you have already seen the plastic bags which were hanging on the tree branches and made it harder for the cleaners to make our campus neat and tidy. But what can we do since the plastic bags are bad for our campus and our world? Here are my suggestions.
  First, find yourself your own shopping bag which is not made by plastic so when you're about to shopping, you can bring it with you. Second, if you saw someone throwing the plastic bag on the ground or into the sea, it won't be nosy if you stand out and stop him or her. This will also do good to the environment. Third, what about spreading the word about the dangers of plastic bags? This may let more people know that the plastic bags are bad for the environment.
  Thank you for reading so far and let's make the world a better place by banning the use of the plastic bags.

 The doorbell rang, echoing in the corridoor. However, no one should be coming at this point of the day. Who is outside the door? I strolled to the door, wondering who might be the unexpected visitor. When I pulled the door open, what came into my view was a face I had seen countless times from my books--I would have never imagined seeing him in real life! She is a famous detective fiction author, and wrote many splendid detective novels which I cherish and are kept in my bookshelves.

Plastics have been with us for decades and plays a huge part of our daily life. Believe me when I say you can find plastic just right next to you, for example some parts of your watter bottle is made of plastics or the pen that sits on your table is made of plastic as well. One of the most used plastic of all time is plastic bags.  As time goes by plastic bags has been more acceptable in our daily use and has a positive outlook for our own needs. Yet, not so many people look at the waste of plastic bags and how it has been ruining our enviroment this whole time! Scientist has prooven that plastic can take up to 450 years to be fully removen in our modern world, so in this essay I would like to talk more about this problem that needs to be fully vanished.
As the generation moves on most people became more self absorbed and only caring about their first priorities rather than the people around us. Plastic bags is the cause of living things such as sea creatures decreasing little by little. This is cause by the fact that we are still using plastic bags up till this day and causing more rubbish in to our ocean and our enviroment. Remember that, we all live on earth and absolutely no one wants to live in a nasty enviroment full of trash and plastic bags flowing around everywhere. Killing animals will definitely ruin our food system living us with barely edible food. I am here to tell you all as a member of this school that every of you can make a huge diffirence in the future right now. Starting from today plastic bags should be banned. Rather than using thin, unsustanable bags, why not use cloth bags or reusable bags? This would create a difference for our mother earth and we can always reused it whenever we like! Without your health our earth would not heal and become a happy place for everyone.

Essay 131:
These years,many supermarkets begin to ban the plastic bags.As for our school,I think we also need to stop using it .Here are my reasons.
First,plastic bags is really harmful to the environment.As we all know,plastic is a kind of material getting from fossil.It takes a lot of time for plastic to get into the earth.Even if it get into the earth,it is also bad to the ground,it can make the ground become worth.Further more,there wasn't any nice way to get the plastic in to another kind of materials.If we throw it into the sea,many sea creatures will eat it by mistake,this may kill a small but valuable life.If the number of the sea creatures decrease, it will also have a big influence on human ourself.
Second,the number of the used plastic bag each year is a lot.Each of us is just one of the seven billion people living onthe earth.Although maybe we just use one plastic bag,the total number is still really shocked.Before we use it we should think about it bad influence.
Third,it is really inconvenient for the cleaner in our school.Most of the plastic bag can ohly be used once,so the whole number of it in our school per day must be huge,this can be a large work for the cleaners.They help us to keep our school clean so why don't we do something to help them feel less stressful?
Further more,some scientists mentioned that some of the plastic are poisonous.This means they are bad for our health,so why do we use them?
All in all,protect the environment is just protect ourselves.Maybe banned using plastc bags will be kind of inconvinient but please understand a thing,that is,the every environmentlly friendly actions you do is just saving the planet for our children.So maybe you can buy a new bag which is made of cotton or cloth instead of a plastic one.Please obey the new school rule.

Essay 134:
Good afternoon students, teachers and parents. I am writing this article to you today, to educate you on the harmful effects of plastic bags to the environment in hopes of reducing our usage of plasic bags as a community. The first victims of our excess production of plastic bags are the turtles. Contrary to common beliefs, plastic bags cannot be degraded, hence they often get thrown into landfills near the ocean. This often results in plastic bags (along with other trash), getting scattered into the ocean, leading to turtles unfortunately mistaking it as food. As a consequence, they fall ill/ die as their body is unable to digest it. According to studies, around 1000 turtles fall victim to our excess production and misplacement of these plastic bags.

Furthermore, the production of plastic bags is causing a mass effect on our environment. This is because a large amount toxic pollutants is emitted into the environment in order to produce plastic bags, further accelerating global warming. This effects have already been shown by statistics as scientist speculate that global warming is happening faster than expected due to the climb of demand of plastic. 

In conclusion, I urge you to reduce your usage of plastic bags in school to a minimum and alternatively use reuseable bags. We, as a community, should unite and endevour to save, protect and preserve our marine life. Although some may argue, that our small community would affect little change, given that plastic bags are still the most produced and consumed material in the world, however I believe that if we are able to ban plastic bags here, we would set an amazing precendent for others to follow. Let us be the generation to create change

Essay 136:
In these recent years, shops snd supermarkets in the country have stopped using plastic bags, I wrote this article to persuade the students in our school to stop using plastic bags as well, down here are some reasons why plastic bags should be stopped using.

Firstly, plastic bags are single used, people only use it once and throw it away. Thrown away plastic bags can pollute the environment includind our land and water. Next, because they're so lightweight, plastic bags can travel long distances by wind and water. After that sea creatures think the plastics bags are food and then eat them, eventually they will choke and starve to death. As these problems occur, people have volunteered to pick up trash in many polluted places including beaches, forests, and in cities also.

Another reason is that plastic bags take a long time to decompose, they make take up thousands of years to decompose completely. Using plastic bags are dangerous for our health too, this is because animals and sea creatures that ate the trash( including plasic bags) end up being our food.

We don't have to stop using them completely, just don't use it one time. Many people reuse plastic bags and some also recycles them into environment-friendly products. I hope the school can stop using plastic bags so we can have a cleaner planet.

I should be the winner because i have some great ideas of benefiting the most from the "one-year supply free chocolate" price. If i successfully get the chance, i will cooperate with the government and persuade the politicians to give us a great place to give the free chocolates out. A great location in my opinion is a place with plenty outside area which i can put tables and chairs, plus a great view that every one can enjoy the scenery. In addition, i won't just give out chocolate bars for free, there will be plenty chocolate products, different shapes, and different food which are made of chocolate. For example, chocolate bar, chocolate cakes, chocolate milk, chocolate ice-cream, and many more. When the selling part adds in, based on my fabulous marking skills, i will make the chocolate shop a hot area which people come and enjoy chocolate while chating with friends and taking gorgeous pictures. The ones that came would be addited to this free and relaxing place, and will gather more and more friends to come and have free chocolates. My ultimate goal is to let the citizens in my region know that there is a great place where you can get delicous chocolate for free and entertain those who comes. There's an old saying, "one passes ten, ten passes hundred." I believe that in a short period of time, lots of people will be attracted and be willing to spend their time at my shop. 
Hope to hear from you soon, and it will be a pleasure to operate this chocolate shop for you. 
Kind regards,

Essay 139:
Plastic bags have become one of the most usual thing we used in the supermarket. It's true that it makes our life more conveient, but we can't ignore the damages it brings to our environemnt. We need take our  responsibility to protect the earth. As being a student, we can start to protect our environment by not using plastic bags in our school. 

We have seen a lot of news and articles about how animals died because of accidently ingest those plastic bags. Plastic bags are really diffcult to decompose. It takes around 300 years to let them decompose completely. So as the numbers of plastic bags being used goes up, there will be more and more of them appear at the site of the sea. It creates a huge ocean pollution that kills thousand of animals because of lack of oxygen in the ocean. Imagine you can't breathe suddenly and you can't do anything for it. It feels terrible, right? That's what the animals under the sea feel when there is a ocean pollution. So for the future of our ocean, for our society, for our planet, please stop using plastic bags! 

Moreover, producing plastic bags require lots of time and people and it is a waste of natural resoures. It seems better to use the natural resources which is scaricty for today society for electricity and heating rather than use it to produce a product that need such a long time to decompose. 21st century is being called as our generation, so it's our responsibility to protect the environment for the next generation.

Essay 141:
It is generally believed that some supermarkets have benned plastic bags in recent years. Some students belived that the school should keep using plastic bags. However, in my opinion, plastic bags should be banned in my school. I am going to elaborate my point in the following paragraphs.
First of all, using plastic bags will pollute the envoirment seriously. Nowadays, many people are using the plastic bags, but the plastic are harmful for the ground. It can pollute crops, when people eat food, they might be get poisoned. And using the plastic bags will make people get sick, more serious cases will lead to disease.
Secondly, using plastic bags will cause the death of sea animals. Today, many sea animals die from eating plastic bags. Not only because people throw plastic bags, but also because people produce plastic bags. There is a kind of harmful gas in plastic bags, which can harm people and animal organs. If sea animals die out, it will cause indescribable harm to people and the world. Land animals are no exception too. 
In conclusion, people needs to reduce the using of plastic bags and the production of the plastic bags, and plastic bags should also be banned at school.

Essay 142:
My favorite superhero would be Spiderman, also known as Peter Parker in his series. I've always admired his character as he was a big part of my childhood. His main appearance has a suit that covers his entire body along with a mask that allows him to see through the eyepatches. It's covered in red, black and blue colors with what seems like to be spiderwebs drawn across his body, with a big black spider icon patched on it's chest. Their special abilities and skills are based off of a spider's abilities such as climbing and sticking onto walls, having able shoot webs out of his wrists and grants him superhuman strength.
Spiderman has kind intentions and polite way to handle things, that's what makes me like more about him. The idea of being based off of a spider and using it's abilities to move around and help others in need is purely kind and amazing. That's what makes me admire him the most out of any other superheros.

Essay 143:
There are a lot of superheros in books or movies, and who is my superhero? My favourite superhero is Wolverine. This essay will look at my superhero and why I like him.
Wolverine is a human adult with hair tilt up on each side. His superpower can stretch out paws from his hand, heal himself very fast, and he is also very strong. Sometimes his healing time can be faster than the time he's getting hurt. Thats why he's so strong in the movie X-man.
I like Wolverine the best is because he never gives up his team mate. He has the leader spirit and mostly he's handsome. I suppose Wolverine is difinitely the optimal superhero to exist.

Essay 144:
Plastic bags have been a staple to our lifestyle for a lengthy amount of time. Huge amounts can be purchased for very cheap, it's fairly easy to dispose, and can be used for a variety of different things. However, plastic bags are a threat to the environment. The core material, plastic, does not break down and because it's very light, plastic bags are able to get stuck in cracks and crevices of the earth. For example, when these bags float into the sea, or a body of water living things such as fish or turtles might get stuck in the plastic or even start to consume it. Chemicals released by the plastic bags get into the soil and ruin it. In the long run, using plastic bags is not worth it for the environment. The good news is, there are so many more sustainable alternatives to fight this problem! Instead of using plastic bags to bring your lunch, or carry around food, reusable totes or lunch bags are fantastic for the job. Let's say you've just done PE and you don't want dirty clothes floating around your backpack, dry bags make cleaning up super easy. All these replacements for plastic bags lasts, are harmless to the environment, and work the same way plastic bags would. We can all help the world by making small changes together. Let's stop using plastic bags!

Plastic bags can lead to serious risks like sea pollution, overflowing landfills, broken down into toxic substances. All though plastic bag is harmful, people still use it because it is convinent and therefore number of serious problems produced by plastic bag has been increasing. 

Here are some reasons why plastic bag should be banned. Firstly, plastic bags can ruin the ecosystem. For example, there are many cases about sea turtle eating plastic bag because they thought that was jelly fish. As a result, the sea turtles died because they are not able to digest the plastic bags. Another reason is that plastic bag can overflow the landfills. Plastics are substances that are hard to decompose, it may need 1000 years to be decompose. In this 1000 years, the plastic bag will be broken down slowly and continue to pollute the environment. Therefore plastic bags should be banned in school. 

People may worry that their banning plastic bags in school may affect them. For example they may need to bring a bag when they are buying things in the school. We can use items like paper bags to replace plastic bags. Shops in school can change to sell paper bags instead of plastic bags to students. If students don't want to buy paper bags from the shops, they can bring their own bag to school. And this won't affect students and it will be covinient too. 

In conclusion, I believe that plastic bags should be banned in the school so we can save the environment and also the animals. According to the ideas above, students can use different items or ways to reduce the number of plastic bag used in the school. We should build a community that cares and therefore the school should ban plastic bags to save the world. 

Essay 146:
My favourite superhero is Wonder Woman. Flowing long black hair, serene face, bright sparkling eyes, magnificent armor and a shining sword -- when people speak of Wonder  Woman, the image of her comes to mind immediately. I still remember I first saw this character on TV. I was pleasantly surprised as the superhero characters were mostly males. Once I had my eyes on her, my eyes were completely glued to the screen as Wonder Woman's stunning looks and her astonishing combat skills captured all of my attention. Wonder Woman possesses inhuman strength, agility, and combat skills, being able to leap really high and sprint for long distances without tiring. I admire Wonder Woman because she has a direct, straight-forward, honest personality: she always says the truth and does not seem to be much exposed to the evils of the world, being innocent and pure even after experiencing a lot. She is kind and selfless, willing to sacrifice herself to save humans. This superhero also means much to me because it is a symbol of the strength of feminity. She is proof that girls can be heroes too and accomplish great things, giving me courage to stand up for myself in daily life. When I encounter troubles in daily life, I always think :  " Wonder Woman would never give up and fight till the end despite difficulties; I must not give up also!" I look up to Wonder Woman as an ideal example and I admire her for all her amazing qualities. I have much to learn from her and she is definitely my favourite superhero!

Dear Bob,

Last night, I had an incredible dream.  I was in a world made up of only food and drinks.  Everything was edible, just like an all-you-can-eat buffet!  There were gingerbread people, candy cane traffic lights, ornage juice rivers, biscuit animals and cars made of hot dogs! 

I saw my family next to me, but to my surprise, they were entirely made of marshmallows.  I began munching ont the trees, which were enormous bunches of broccoli, but instead of brocolli, honey was oozing out.  Suddenly, it was snowing ice-cream everywhere.  I saw a gigantic drumstick and rushed to get a bite, but I woke up to discover that I rolled out of bed.  It was heaven for a child who likes to eat, like me.

I wish that I could visit this world again in the future.  It is the best dream

The scene is quite frighteneing for me. Therefore, I think a cheetahs is a dangerous creature.
Despite its threatening looks, a cheetah can only chirp like a bird! When I first saw cheetahs, I thought they will roar loudly like lions. I was very surprised when I heard their sound at first.

Here he comes! Swinging through the city! From an ordinary human, to a superhero that saved millions of lives, just in one night! The films about him showed how powerful he was as a sueprhero, but also his strength thoughout his childhood which was filled with loss. My favourite superhero is SpiderMan! SpiderMan, also known as Peter Parker, is a young boy that has arachnid like powers, he wears a red and blue creepy yet cool suit and has self-designed web shooters to catch and criminal in sight. He also mastered a special skill called "Spider Sense", it warns him of  upcoming danger. As stealthy as a cheetah, as sneaky as a thief, he always manages to save humanity. 

After his beloved Uncle Ben died to a burglar, grief-stricken Peter was determined to protect his city, and thoughout his missions, he learnt a indispensable lesson, "With great power come great responsibility". I adore Spiderman because it is very relatable since he goes through somethingthat basically everyone has to go through. When he has power, he forgets about family and his responsibility and he also has problems with relationships and guilt. I'm sure that's the case for most teenagers at his age. Also, another reason why I adore spiderman so much is because of his superhuman powers, clinging to walls like bats, swinging to places like monkies, and using webs to catch "prey" like spiders. 

SpiderMan is such an iconic, intelligent and heroic superhero. He is in everyone's childhood memories, and I'm sure everyone would wish to have his powers to save the world!

In modern times, there are lots of different celebrities who are all famous for a variety of things.

In the unlikely event of a celebrity visiting my home, he/she would likely be famous because of the books he/she writes since I enjoy reading. Reading is like water to me, I need it to survive. My favourite author is J.K Rowling. She has hair the shade of copper which frames her face elegantly, matching with her long and elegant nose. She has stunning and bright blue eyes and thin lips. J.K Rowling is most famous for her book series Harry Potter. I am fascinated with the way she can make an entire world with words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters.

If she ever did visit me, I would make sure to prepare a lot of questions about the process of writing, for example, 'Is writing and publishing a book distressing and tiring in any way?' I would ask these questions because I would like to become a writer someday since in my opinion, spinning a world out of words seems very tempting and also interesting. It would be an exciting way to share my thoughts to people all across the world.

The thing I wouldn't hesitate to show her would be my study room. This is because books are scattered everywhere in my room. My books are my most precious possesions and I usually don't return all of them to the bookshelf since it is already brimming with books. There even is a loose nail in the corner because of the weight of all the books. I sincerely hope that J.K Rowling would approve of my messy book-filled room. I would also show her some of the short descriptions of different places I have written over the years and ask for her commentary and advice.

It would be such a huge wonder if J.K Rowling, or any celebrity, came to visit my home.

I come home after class, really tired. However, I discover my mom is wearing a strange facial expression and she says," someone is coming to our house. You will scream when you see!" 
Opening the door with some confusement and some excitement, I see a very familiar shadow, tall and thin. "No way... Are you...Hanyu Yuzuru?" The person turns around, which makes me scream loudly,"God! I cannot believe my eyes!"
Hanyu Yuzuru is one of the most famous and legendary ice skater around the world, with countless honors and records throughout his life as an athlete. He became exdroadinarily well-known after the Beijing Winter Olympic Game. His appearence, proffesional skills and the attitude toward ice skating and everyone around him gained him a huge population of fans in different countries.
Hanyu smiles at me. I run in front of him, saying," I am a fan of you for many years. I have so many things I want to tell you, but...but I cannot calm my mind. First of all, congradualations to you for becoming a professional ice skating perfomer and please continue to skate for yourself and the expectations of fans. Umm...I don't know what I want to say.

Essay 162:
  Have you ever seen some strange animal? If yes, which one do you think is the strangest? For me, the strangest animal I have seen is octopus. They live in the sea and they look totally different from most of the marine species. The most obvious example is that they have eight legs that full of suckers. Also, their body are able to pass through a tiny seam and the minimum size of the seam depends on how big their mouth is. It is because their hole body are soft and flexible except their mouth. 
  The reason why I think octopus is the strangest animal I have ever seen is that they are very intelligent. Their IQ are as same as a little child which is very top in animalia. Moreover, they are very good at escape. For example, if they are caught by the fishermen, they will keep on looking for a gap that allow them to escape. Last but not least, they have a talent for imitating others' action. There is a experiment that talks about this ability. In the experiment, the octopus will be blocked in a jar. Then a man show it how to open the jar in another room. After a while, that octopus opened the jar in a same way as the man's did. This shows that they have tha ability on imitating others' action.
  Octopus is really an interesting and intelligent animal and thats the reason why I think it is the stangerest animal I have ever seen.

My favorite superhero is Spider-man, he wears a red superhero suit that covers his whole body from head to toe and it's really tight. It has black stripes that represents the webs, and he wears a black bracelet that shoots out the webs.

His webs are really strong and stretchy, he swings everywhere with his webs. He can shoot it out like a rope and a net, and it is also almost impossible to break. Spider-man saves people from the evil humans that wants to destroy the earth, he risks his life just to ensure people are safe and not hurt. I really admire Spider-man because he is very kind-hearted and generous to people, and he is also very brave. He is very young and still has a long way to go but he decides to save people as a hero instead of having a normal teenage life like other teenagers, that's why i really admire him. He has lost a lot of his loved ones but he never gives up, he doesn't only care about the people he knows or love, but he also cares about other people he has never met before.

Essay 168:
Nowdays, the recycling process of plastic became a problem to human. So people had a heated debate about whether plastic bags should be banned. In my opinion, plastic bags should not be sold and students should not to use it anytime anywhere. 

Firstly, plastic bags are harmful to the environment. Plastic is a material that not human but also nature can not recycle. If people burn the plastic garbages, the gases that they made can kill lots of people all over the world. Also, these litter will pollute soil if human put them under ground. For example, the scientists went to the north face of Earth to burn plastics to find the solution of the plastic problem. however, we had not find the best way to deal with it. So, plastic bags are harmful to the environment and Earth.

Moreover, using plastic bags form a bad habit to people. Everyone should be prepared before they want to do something. However, people will not prepare a bag before shopping if the supermarkets provide plastic bags, that will lead to a bad atmosphere of the society. 

Lastly, using plastic bags may lead to many problems even wars between countries. For example, Japan had put the polluted water to the ocean and many countries are angry with Japan's action. That is because that Japan polluted the Earth. As a result, using plastic bags may be a problem between countries. 

So, we should not using plastic bags angmore so that our Earth will be more pretty.

Essay 169:
Dear students,
  It might have come to your attention, that in recent years, supermarkets reduced the use of plastic bags. Plastic bags are successful and beneficial intentions, they are convenient and easy to produce. As a result, it is confusing to see plastic bags getting banned. However, I totally agree with the 'supermarket policy'.
  To commence with, plastic bags are damaging to the environment. The reason is that plastic bags are made of plastics, making them hard to dissolve. Once you throw it away,  the only way to deal with it is to bury it in the soil. As a consequence, the plastic bag remains there for decades, then ends up with harmful chemicals. The plants there are not able to grow, and the herbs do not have food to eat. A little plastic bag can cause an unchangeable disaster to the environment.
  Further, as you can see on TikTok, YouTube, and in newspapers. Lots of animals died because they mistakenly ate plastic items or were unable to breathe because of a plastic bag stuck in their mouths. pitiful and unbearable news comes one by one. If you still pay little attention to the horrible results that humans made by just a small mistake. The earth will be surrounded by plastic bags. And the next who would be killed by plastic bags might be human lives.
  From all the above, this is what I strongly support for the ban on plastic bags. Not only I should do it, but also my dearest classmates that I have seen and greeted on every beautiful morning thanks to the gorgeous environment. I implore you, to stop using plastic bags instead of reusable bags. It takes step by step to bring back the lovely home for the species killed by light and small plastic bags. It starts with you and me. Please stop using plastic bags at school and elsewhere. By doing so, we are contributing to a better world.

It should be considered to ban the usage of plastic bags at schools for the reasons of saving the environment, prevention of pullution, and declining the amount of plastic used in the world today. To start off, using plastic bags has an extremely negative impact on our environment, such as plastic bags thrown out on the ground, or people throwing them out in garbage cans that are not specifically made for plastic bags.

Why banning plastic bags might just save our earth

Plastic bags are everywhere in our environment as it is common for it's convinience. However, the convience of these plastic bags come at a very high cost to the environment and negatively affects human health, therefore is using plastic bags really worth destroying our planet for? I believe not. In fact, in recent yers some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags, thus it should also be banned at our school.

FIrst, plastic bags are harmful to wildlife and marine life. As plastic bags do not degrade, they are broken down into small tiny pieces after disposal and end up in oceans, which are then consumed by wildlife. Birds, animals, and marine life such as sea turtles and fish often mistake them for food and consume them, causing them to die from suffocation, not to mention that these plastic bags are filled with toxic harmful chemicals which is also harmful to their health.

Second, plastic bags can cause pollution to out environment. Plastic bags are usually lightweight, and as such, they can travel very long distances by either water or wind. They might end up in between trees, fences, or even floating along the river, polluting nature. Furthermore, they are even hard to remove from the environment, therefore by looking at the average plastics bags disposed from humans in the whole world, we can see how serious the plastic bags pollute the environment.

Essay 181:
Plastic bags should be banned at our school
Nowadays,more and more supermarkets in Australia begin to ban plastic bags.They use paper bags that can be recycled to replace the plastic bags.As we are Australian students ,I think our school should also stop using the plastic bags ,because those bags are harmful to the environment and not as strong as our own clothe bag.
Firstly,plastic bags have a bad effort on the environment.Sea pollution is very seiourly now,one of the reasons that cause sea pollution is plastic bags.We use them and throw them into the rubbish bin,howvever,it is very hard for goverment to deal with those white rubbish.The governments of some countries chose to leave them in the sea., so sea pollution happened.Some goverments burn the plastic bags in order to clean them quickly.It's even worse to the enviroment,the black smoke that is proudced by the burning plastic bags can pollute the air.If we don't stop such action ,we may can't breathe after ten years.
Secondly,plastic bags are not as strong as our own clothe bags.Bring your own bags can not only save some money but also prevent some  embarress things happen.For example,we buy a plastic whitch is not very strong,
IN colustion,I think plastic bags should be banned at our school.

 

Essay 182:
There are a lot of things to give up as a celebrity, such as time, energy, sleep, and much more. But for their personal life, I really think that it is unreasonable to expect all celebrities to give up their personal life as they are still humans, they are just same as us. Celebrities have to spend time and energy not only to satisfy the audience, but to spend time doing what they want to do outside of celebrity things.
Firstly, all celebrities have families and friends, just like we do. If we were a celebrity we would want to take some time off and spend time with our loved ones and our friends. And if celebrities don't interact with their friends and families, they might worry about the whereabouts of the celebrities. which is the last thing their families and friends want to happen. Celebrities would also love to know about the conditions that their families are at, the last thing they want might also be not able to connect with their families. A lot of celebrities would rather give up their careers just to spend more time with their families and friends.
Secondly, celebrities also have hobbies outside of maybe making a movie or playing sport competitions. For example, a professional basketball player, Wardell Stephen Curry, also loves playing golf and is often times spotted playing golf with his family and friends. Celebrities would also need time to rest and catch on to the real world and about what's happening outside of the celebrity world.
Although celebrities must have time to do things other than their duties, they must not neglect what the audience wants. They should also priorities their time and energy on how much they spend on the audience and their own personal life. They should fulfil the audiences wishes to an extent or have a limit to what they should do or what they shouldn't based on the celebritiy's morality. There isn't really a straight line on weather or not listening to the public about this or that is right or wrong. But there has to be a "bottom line" to everything that they do or don't do.
To wrap this up. In my opinion, there is no straight answer to weather giving up their personal life is good or bad, but obviously they'll have to consider a bit about their personal life. It's mostly just if the celebrity is happy and having a wonderful time.

Essay 183:
Nowadays , people love shooping so much they just can't help doing it,while shopping,people often wastes a lot of plastic bags , and that caused a lot of harm to the environment.
Because of that , some supermarkets in number of countries have banned plastic bags.I think our school shall ban plastic bags for the environment as well.
There are a few reasons of why we shall ban plastic bags.First,plastic bags cannot be reused.When they are used one or two times , most of the people will choose to throw them away,and get a new one,that produces a large amount of trash that will cause harm to the environment.Its not environmentally friendly.Second , some of the careless students may throw them on the corridor or in the classrooms.Plastic bags are quite slippery , the plastic bags on the walkway may trip someone or cause an accident.We don't want that to happen and cause harm to students or teachers.At last , plastic bags are hard to dissolve , if it was disposed into the nature,it will take hundreds of years to dissolve.If a large amount of plastic bags are disposed,it may even affect the food chain,at last,humans will pay for what they have done.
Somebody may asked,'What can we use to replace plastic bags?'The best solution is for students or teachers to bring their own bags to school.The other solution is to replace plastic bags with paper bags . Plastic bags cannot be reused as well as paper bags,but paper bags are easier to dissolve and its harmless for most of the animals.Its not the perfect solution but I think it will cause less harm to humanbeings and the environment.
I hope our school and students can take action after reading my article,for the sake of the environment and most importantly,for ourselves.

  A person knocked on my door. Slowly, I opened the entrance. A man with black, curly hair stepped forward, his big eyes stared into mine,  and his skinny hands reached forward -- Hanyu Yuzuru! He is the champion of many Olympic games, and the gold medals reflect rays of sunlight that pierced my eyes. "Hello! I never thought you would come! My mom made some cookies. Quick, come inside." I said happily as he stepped into my house. He's famous for his ice skating skills. He's also great at studying, and he continuously calculates the time or angle that is best for landing and how to improve his skills. My mom always says that my sister and I should learn from him -- be determined just like he always wants to jump a 4A on the Olympics ( jumping and spinning four and a half time, no one had ever tried this before.) That is why I'm be so excited to meet him. I also asked him how to be so determined on a specific thing and why he chose to ice skate in the first place. After all these questions, I showed him our house. First, my sister's room, especially the little doll she made of Hanyu. Then, he followed me to the garage, where a wooden structure of him sits. He's pleased to see these things and claims we are all good at crafting. When it was time to leave, we said goodbye and waved at him as his shadow slowly disappeared in the distance......

Essay 189:
     The door creaks open, numerous shreaks arise from my lungs as a strange yet familiar person sets foot into the house. This scene will be played when a famous person comes to my home, and most likely, she will be a figure skating athlete; or even better, an olympic medalist. If such dreams are to come true, the visitor should feel delighted after the visit, as everything has already been planned through my imaginations: the witness of her beauty, the dialogue between us, and even the tour around the house.
    As she enters the room, she shall be wearing daily clothes in which usual teenagers wear, unlike those dresses which were worn for competition. Since she's an athlete, she wouldn't be extroadinarily tall, but is rather around the average height. She will look rather muscular but soft within, and walk gracefully through the doors, glancing around the house. She is famous since she got a medal in the Olympics, proving her ability as an athlete, but also rising her fame among people. Another reason would be that she skates gorgeously and is extremely eye catching, causing more people to become interested in her as well as to like her. With these backgrounds, she had became a considerably famous person around the globe.
     I should greet her and bow in respect, showing my admiration towards her. She too would smile and convey her appreciation of my support. I then will tell her my love in the sport of figure skating and probably ask for professional advices, since this is a crucial and unique chance in my life. Later, it would be entertaining to sit down and ask some questions about her own experiences and progress in iceskating during her childhood if it's available.
     Finally, bringing her onto a tour of the house is similarly critical, as it can deepen her understanding of me as well as bring more interest into the visit. If I had the chance, I will show her some pictures of her in my room to demonstrate her importance towards me. I will also show her some of my own hobbies and introduce her some of my favorite books, in order to connect more with her. Other unimportant small things may be shared as well to build a tighter bond between us and to create a warming atmostphere for this visit.
     With all these plans illustrated above, it will be a successful tour in the house and an exciting experience for the visitor as well.

Essay 191:
When was the last time that you used a platic bag? Actually, the most normal answer of the question above is yesterday. It's because we live in a world which develops rapidly. However, it's necessary for people to stop using the plastic bag since it has absolutely negative effects to the environment. 

The most essential environmental issue of the plastic bag is that it decays extremely slow. Indeed, plastic bags need to take more than two years to accomplish decaying. Hence, people should use other methods, which also hurt our environment to help plastic bags to decay. For instance, scientists in my country suggest to collect plastic bags and burn them. It seems like a useful way because the speed of buring is quick, while the carbon dioxide and other chemical things produced from burning bring huge impact to the environment, which caused the air of my country becomes not as fresh as before.

In addition, more demands for this kind of bag accelerate unpleasant influences of the plastic bag. I believe that all of you have heard about the news that shows the accumlation of plastic bags everywhere, especially in the ocean. Needless to say, the population of organisms which live in the ocean will decrease when there are tons of garbage like plastic bags in there. Then, the amount of marine food that we eat becomes less and the quality of the water we use and drink becomes bad.

Due to lots of disadvantages of the plastic bag, it's important for us to ban the plastic bag and find other bags to replace it. There are two advisable ways that we can follow to protect our world. Firstly, we can use some environmental friendly bags which are made by wood or other natural materials. Secondly, we can purchase one plastic bag, and always use it until it breaks. In conclusion, let's stop using plastic bags in order to help our environment

Mobile phones. An invention that has improved billions of people's life quality by making communication way easier than what we had 4 decades ago. But with such advantage comes a lot of disadvanteges such as spending less time outside.etc. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages that comes with such easy communication.
Firstly, mobile phones can improve relationships with our family, reletives and friends. Back before mobile phones were a thing, family members are seperated during working hours and weren't able to chat with each others and they had to wait untill they're home to be even able to greet. But now, we can talk to each other with just a fews of a button. We can know more about our own family and understand the work environment of each other. Which can make the already strong bond in the family even stronger with ease. 
Secondly, parents won't have to worry too much as their kids have phones, they can call their parents in an emergency or call for help if they are in danger. Friends will also fell better to know that they can communicate with their friends easily. Friends can also plan a meetup online instead of having the need to meet up in person just to plan when to eat lunch together.
But with all the advantages and happiness. There also has a disadvantage to having the ability to communicate easily. For a lot of teenagers, they might lose the will to meet their friends in person since they can call their friends or chat with them in messaging apps without even leaving their bed. This will for sure ruin their mental health and physical health for not going outside. Which will cause teens to feel as if they are useless in the outside world as the world functions normally without them even stepping outside of their room. This will make them feel depressed and sad, as they start to make themselves only look at the bad side of things and not try to find a way out as they can always escape the real world through the online world.
But in my opinion. As long as we use our mobile phone in the right way and that we can impact ourselves or others for the better, it's a wonderful invention.

Happy. A feeling that a lot of teenagers might think has abandoned them and are longing to have the same feeling of going to the beach for the first time. You might think that you've grown too old for happiness to flow into your life. But don't worry, here you can find advices to regain the happiness that you thought you've lost from a teenager who is enjoying his life and is happy about his current situation.
Firstly. Enjoy everything at it's fullest and get the most out of everything. When you're doing the things that you love, rather it's going out with friends. You might often come across times when you think happy times are often short and they aren't worth having as they're so short. Everything has an end, and it happens with both happy and sad times. Remeber, it's rather you've enjoyed it or learned anything from it. So when you notice that you're having the short and happy times, remember to enjoy every second of it and treasure every moment of it. Be happy it happened, don't be sad it ended.
Secondly. Don't overthink about the accidents or mistakes you've caused or made. I myself have came across mistakes or accidents that I didn't want to happen. Back then I would cry myself to bed after a little mistake I made and overthink about it for days. One day I was tired of this and I wanted to feel happier and worry less. So on that day onwards, I told myself that i have to learn from my mistakes and try to prevent that from happening ever again. Mistakes were meant to make and as long as you don't redo the same mistake and are really sorry for your actions, it's alright. Everything is worth learning from and most importantly, learn from your mistakes try your best to prevent it.

To the radio station,
   Good afternoon, how are you today? 
   It's my pleasure to write this email to you, explaining why I should win the competition and what I will do with the whole year of free chocolate. 
   On warm days, when the temperature is just good for sports. I would like to give out my chocolate to my classmates, teachers, neighbors, and every passenger. Spread love and joy all over the world, and do as much as I can. 
   Chocolate has always been my favorite on cold days. Enjoying the lovely snow outside while having chocolate is one of my most pleasant things. It helps me to have more energy to face the cold wind and get ready for a new day of hard work. I can also make hot chocolate with free chocolate. What's more, it will be more joyful if I can share the warmth in my heart with a bar of hot chocolate given to those who work hard even it's snowing heavily outside. Let's imagine the happiness of every normal and common face.
   Furthermore, if I win the competition and get free chocolate for a year. I will donate some of the chocolate to poor people in some areas, such as the middle east. These people are suffering from wars, diseases, and hunger. Children die for not having enough food. I just can't bear to see more tragedies happen all around the world.
   Generally speaking, I really want to win the competition and share my reward with the world. I'm just a student, I can't make the world better. But I want to try my best to help the people around me. Sharing the happiness that I have in my life. Thank you for letting me have this opportunity!
                                                                                                                                          Misty Chen

If a famous person came to my house then I imagine them to be Bts Jimin. He is really handsome and kind towards everyone he sees. He is Korean and right now he has brown hair with some tattoos on him. Jimin is also the shortest out of Bts but is an amazing dancer. His nicknames are ChimChim, Mochi and Diminie. Jimin is part of BTS, one of the world's biggest boy bands, with their fans named Bts. Bts started getting more attention in 2017, which is when fans started noticing Jimin. He was seen as an exceptional dancer among the members of BTS and kpop in general. People praised him for having smooth and elegant movements. Not only this but he is hilarious and knows how to keep people entertained. Jimin has phenomenal visuals and talent. His voice has captured many fans as they describe it as heavenly. The first thing I would say to Jimin is how much he has impacted my life, as Bts's main goal in their music is to make people themselves. Jimin has been my role model for years and I just want him to know that people do care about him as he has low self-esteem and thinks of himself as lowly. I would also tell him that there are millions of people who are willing to listen to his troubles as he doesn't have people whom he can always rely on to talk to. I would mainly just talk about how great he is and how he has helped so many people love themselves again.  I would show them lyrics where I have annotated them so he knows that his songs truly do have an impact on us. I would also show him my plants as he really enjoys nature.

It is important to keep our Earth clean and beautiful,The earth is becoming more and more dirtier now,beacause human need to develop.But along with industrialization,it also destroyed the earth's environment.This also includes plastic bag pollution.So I think plastic bags should be banned at our school.There are some reasons of my opinion.
First,plastic bags will pollute the environment,plastic bags are hard to disapper on their own so that human need to burn millions of plastic bags which people have used before every year.This will make the air beacome not clean as before.If people always breathe dirty air,their body may beacome bad.Can you imagine your famliy or your friends body become very bad?This is why some supermarkets in a number og countries have banned plastic bags in recent years.
What's more,we don't need to buy something always with a plastic bag.Now,more and more countries have ddeveped many new types of bags instead of Plastuc bags.The new types of bags won't make pollution to our mother land.We always use plastic bag to carry something,but after that we just throw it to the ban,it is such a waste for students,even for people.So why not to use a new type of bag to shopping instead of plastic bags which will destory our environment and bad for our health.
Finally,let's protect our earth and the environment together.Plastic bags should be banned at our school,isn't it?

Everyone has their own superheros,and I am not an exeption.Some of them like Captain America,while others may like Spiderman.However,I like Harry Potter best.So,today I will introduce my favourite superhero--Harry Potter to you.
Firstly,I would like to say that Harry Potter has a normal apperance,but not normal when he has the scar.It was made by Lord Voldemort--the most dark wizard for all the time.When Harry was one year old,Voldemort came to Harry's house to catch their parents--James Potter and Lily Potter.Although both of his parents died in that attack,surprisingly,he survived from it.And Voldemort goes away,but leave him with a scar of the Killing Curse.So when wizards see a scar on someone's forehead,they will know that he is Harry.But exept for his scar,he just wear a pair of old glasses and he has two big blue eyes.
Harry Potter,as we all know,learn magic at Hogwarts.But besides his great magic skills,he really has a good braveness.As most of students didn't stands out for the justice,he does.However,when Hogwarts is in great danger,he and his friends are the only who stands out.
I actually really admire Harry's professional magic skills.As a child,I really want to have the special power so that I could be the strongest at class.But when I get older and older,I found that Harry Potter has other skills we can learn from.For example,as I just wrote,he has a good braveness.And he also has the skill to never give up,although you are in a great danger and ther are no help.These are all we can learn from him.
That is all about my favourite superhero--Harry Potter.If you never see this movie,give it a try! I am sure that you would be amazed about him!

My favorite season is summer not winter. Because during summer, you can eat ice cream when it's hot without getting brain freeze easily. when we get brain freeze our brain just hurts a lot and it just hurts to eat so if you want an exuse to eat ice cream.  However during winter you get to eat hot stuff and hot drinks like hot chocolate, hot pot. etc. But summer is perfect for swimming because, the water might be cold and when it is summer the sun is shining on you so intensly that you will easily get sunburned. During winter most of the time you get a good break from work and can go traveling. You could go to a hot spring for a relaxing time or you could receive christmas gifts during winter! But personaly my favorite thing about summer is that I get a one month and two week break from school and can go almost anywhere and visit my friends, I  can even go on a beach with lemonade and relax on a soothing floating mat. And that is why summer is my prefered season over winter.

Essay 252:
I am sure most of you realize that our earth is slowly dying. One of the main reason this is happening is because of pollution. Due to pollution, we can see the changes that are happening around us such as, the changes in the temperature, weather, and environment. There are two main types of pollution; air pollution and water pollution. Today, I'm disccusing mostly about the water pollution and how we can help our earth get better. Water pollution starts from the trash we produce everyday, more specifically, plastic trash. The plastics such as: cups, spoons, straws, and bags that we use everyday are dangerous for our environment/earth. If these plastics are not discarded in the right way, they can end up in the ocean which will harm the sea life. From there the cycle begins, most of the earth's body of water is going to start to get polluted and if it happened as said before our sea life will get harmed especially our coral reefs which is not going to be good for everyone. We can start preventing this by reducing the use of plastics like instead of using plastic bags, we can use reusable bags instead. Even though this is a small start it will definetely help our earth to get better and safe for us all.

Essay 255:
     One sunday afternoon, Albert Einstein comes into my home. He is famous for his studies on theoratical physics. He is just like any old neighbour, kind and warm, filled with wisdom. He has dense, grey hair that could be compared to an alpine tree covered with a moderately thick layer of snow in winter. He also has a grey mustache spreading across his face. Looking down, I see him wearing a green sweater and a long pair of grey pants that just fits him. He is also wearing a pair of light-brown shoes which were polished. I offer him a seat and pour him a cup of tea, as I ask him, "Mr. Einstein, can you explain me the physics behind a white hole? Since it repels things, wouldn't it be a positive curve in the fabric of space and time?"
After having a (preferrably lengthy) discussion about theoratical physics, I show him works of other theoratical physicians, to showcase how far the subject he has dedicated his whole life to has gone.
     In the end, I bid farewell to him, as he leaves my home through the front door.

He told me that his job was to defend the enemies from entering the cities,and the enemies' armies are much stronger than ours. So as soon as I and him finished this day, he took me to practice for fighting, shooting, and bombing. In these three, I was excel at shooting, even one enemy walking very fast cannot came out of my eyesight. I did shot him that day. And I get a reward of a jar of sardin fish for shooting the first enemy.

After the first shot of the enemy, I bacame more braver and stronger. Many soldiers had known my "legacy" of killing the first enemy. But the enemy still doesn't know why they lost one of their people.

Once when I'm at the battlefields, I killed many of the enemies, but I got hurt badly. Before I die, I carried the bombs to their main quarters, and boomed the quarters. Many soldiers were very sad about it. So they use all their strengths to destroy the whole enemy force.

Suddenly,I woke up and recognized it was just a dream. But it told me that I need to be ready for fighting the enemies outside anytime!


Truly yours,

Essay 258:
   Have you ever wondered why most supermarkets have banned plastic bags? Plastic bags are one of the most harmfull things that harm the environment, therefore, more and more supermarkets around the world are starting to ban the usage of plastic bags. We as a school can take part in being a part of this movement, and ban the usage of plastic bags in our school. The reason why plastic bags are so harmful is because they are not easy to recycle, harmful to soil and it takes a very long time for them to dissolve on land. 

   The plastic bags used and thrown in bins don't get recycled, and the ones that are recycled cost a lot of money. Because of the material that are used in plastic bags, it's not an easy task to recycle them. Therefore, they get thrown away, where they stay in nature for years. Because of that, instead of recycling, new plastic bags get made because of the fact that it's cheaper then regular bags, and this causes a problem at a larger scale. The unrecycled plastic bags are also mostly thrown away on the streets, carried by the wind. Those kind of plastic bags take hunderds of years to dissolve and are extremely harmful to soil. 
   
   Plastic bags are one of the most toxic things to soil and natural life. You may probably have seen pictures of animals in water with plastic bags stuck to them. Those animals will most likely have to live like that for the rest of their lives. Along with that, plastic bags that are left on soil are very harmful. They also don't dissolve there for a long period of time, so it will keep damaging the soil for a long time. 

   The last reason why plastic bags should not be allowed in our school is becuase of the extreme time it takes for these bags to dissolve. A plastic bag left on the nature or anywhere can survive for hundreds of years. Plus, considering that they are very dangerous to nature and animals, this means that they harm the environment for hundreds of years. 

   In summary, every plastic bag that is thrown away or not recycled is a toxic substance for the environment to deal with for the next hundreds of years. What we can at least do is ban the usage of plastic bags in our school, so that we can at least have a small impact on this movement. The world is in our hands, and we should do whatever we can to make it a better place.

  Bates are the strangest animal in the world.Their fur are black and grey,and have two big wings that help them fiy.Besides, bates are the only mammel that can fly.Futhermore,they have two big ears like triangle, and they help them use echo to catch food and find the way home .Their eyes are very big so they make them a little bit cute, but their eres are useless in the dark night. They also have two hands which have three fingers on each hand but no use at all.Their feet are also very big, and they help them sleep safely.Their look are so strange that I even don't know why god would make them.
  Not only their look is very strange, but also the place they live is very strange.Bates live in the cave .The cave is very cold,wet and dark.They often sleep in morning and catch food at night. They always sleep upside down and use their toes to hang themselves on the top of the cave like a ice cone. However, sometimes bates' toes cannot hold their weight and then they will fall down from the top of the cove.So that's why bates are all very small and light ,if they are too heavy they will fall down from the top of the cave ,drop on the ground and maybe die. So that's another reason why I think bates are very strange.
  Bates' look and the place they live are all very strange. That is why I think bates are the strangest animal I've ever seen.

Plastic bags have been a negative impact on human life and wildlife over the years. It has caused pollution to arise and has endangered a lot of species both on and off the land. According to recent studies, scientists have shown that banning plastic bags in some countries' supermarkets has decreased the amount of plastic waste and pollution in that areas. This evidence shows that banning plastic bags could improve our environmental health in many different ways. Like other countries, Our school should try to do the same by banning plastic bags and making a difference in our society for a cleaner environment. We could start by limiting plastic bags and replacing them with other recyclable bags when going out. We could always keep one in your purse or backpack would be beneficial because you will always have one ready, even if you weren't intended to have one that day. We could also make posters around the neighborhood, spreading our word with posters so that we could make this impact bigger. Even though our school is a small society, I believe that we will be able to spread our words and our actions around the country so that we will have a chance of living in a cleaner and healthier environment.

Essay 261:
  Plastic bags are known and used worldwide for their convenience and versatility. They are easily stored, used, produced, and are non-toxic to use on most occasions. Despite their countless advantages, they also bring long-term dangers to the world, such as air pollution, sea pollution, land pollution. I strongly believe that their disadvantages vehemently outweigh their advantages and that we should take action to reduce the use of plastic bags in our school.

  First and foremost, plastic bags contributes to the worsening of air pollution when being produced in large scale productions. In order to produce plastic bags, factories undergo different processes, and one of the major processes is heating. However, heating releases a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, which is the cause of global warming. Moreover, the different processes might produce toxic gases, which are harmful to society and animals.

  When plastic bags enter the sea, it leads to sea pollution. We odten see cases of sea creatures accidentally eating these plastic bags. However, they can not digest it or the chemicals in the plastic bag might be toxic for them, causing numerous deaths of the sea creatures and an imbalance in the ecosystem.

  Thirdly, plastic bags contains chemicals that are extremely hard to decompose. They do not decompose even after hundreds of years. This phenomenon adds up to landfill pollution, and affects the world long-term.

  By reducing the use of plastic bags, we can help change the world for the better. It decreases the rate of pollution and climate change worsening and provides a clean, safer, more hygenic earth for the future generations. Hence, we as students, should take action and not use plastic bags at school anymore.

Essay 262:
Hello fellow students and teachers, around the world, we have experienced many different changes with our world including the vast technology advancement through cars, phones and even different travel methods from areas that we never thought will be possible a hundred years ago. However, the many benefits that came from the advancement of human society has also had its drawbacks, climate change, decline in mental health, and the use of harmful objects that indirectly affect the planet such as plastic. In this article, I would be explaining why we should be banning plastic bags in our prosperous school.

First and foremost, plastic bags are extremely difficult to decompose safely. Most things around the world decompose and give back the energy to the soil beneath our feet, plastic bags on the other hand dont decompose after many unreal circumstances, like being eaten, being left to rot and even being burnt up into flames. All three methods of decomposition is detrimental to the environment. Letting the plastic being eaten by other animals would most likely strangle the animal or make it stay inside the animal killing them slowly, if it were to be captured by food hawlers, the animal that ate it would be served to some of us which would indirectly mean that we are eating plastic. Leaving it to rot on the other hand would take years to decompose and would likely damage all of the surrounding environment and all of this would be for a one time use of convienience. After the first two options, burning plastic would seem to be the most optimum way to get rid of plastic. However this might be the most dangerous way to get rid of plastic. Not only plastic is extremely durable, many plastic particles is light enough to blend into the air around us which would mean that we would be breathing plastic. 

Secondly, plastic waste has been used all around the world and millions of tonnes of plastic is sent to the landfill every year. According to a variety of different sources, it is stated that there have been over 400 million tonnes of plastic waste each year around the globe. As a school, we could be contributing to the cause by the many tonnes of plastic waste that we produce every day like packing food, using them as bottles and much more. We as a school could produce over 1000 tonnes of plastic waste alone per year. This number should not be allowed to rise any further as this issue could be stopped if we were to ban the entire school from using plastic. 

In conclusion, if the entire school were to completely stop the use of plastics in general, we could contribute to slowing down the crisis of climate change and help protect the environment better. With our the luxury of learning about this topic, lets all rise against plastic usage and protect the earth from climate change together.

Essay 268:
Dear Radio Daily,

The competition was based upon the community voting for the most voted music or art piece within a month. However, I believe I should be the winner of the music category. All the free chocolate within the prize has also made me hungry for success which led me to write to Radio Daily, about why I should be the winner of the music category.

The music I produced had been in the works even before the competition even started. Looking at my passion for music, I understood that writing a song that had a backstory and meaning to it would be a very difficult task and would need much care in the studio to perfectly craft a masterpiece which is music. Fortifying my script with other music artists' consideration, without a shadow of a doubt could be the next big hit when it drops down.

Coming out of Yale School of Music with a Bachelor's degree, I believe that I would be more than qualified to differentiate the difference between a well-written song and a rushed song.  Yale School of Music was not an easy task as I dropped almost every part of my academic freedom and placed it in a risky industry. The world of music is a vast one and I studied hard to get first-class honors in my year group. Studying the culture of music has given me the inspiration to write my songs and hopefully become an artist one day my starting point is winning this competition. 

Knowing the prize is a one-year supply of chocolate, there could be an extensive list of ideas of what I could do with it. Eating all of the chocolate would not be the smartest choice as it could leave me in a much worse place which could make me have an addiction to chocolate. Instead, I would be thinking about using the chocolate for good and giving them out to the less fortunate. Not only would it be easier for the load to not be wasted, but could also help with my personal reputation and my love for the community. I would also keep some for myself to eat and maybe bake some cake if I find the time to. 

To conclude my statement, the music competition will not only be a great start to my career but would also be a delicious treat for the community.

Thank you for your time,
Christopher

  For this essay, I will imagine that the world chess champion Magnus Carlsen comes to my home. He is neither tall nor short, has short hair and a very cleanly shaved beard, and does not wear any glasses (despite having played a lot of chess). He is famous because, well, he is the world chess champion.
  If he comes to my home, I would say: "Hello, may I have just one chess game with you now?" By his nature, he will say yes, of course. After that, I will film the whole chess game to post it on Youtube sometime later. Sometimes, chess grandmasters will play some very strange openings to most people, so I will let him explain what openings were played in that game. I'd also like to make progress in chess, so I will talk to him during the game to gather ideas for the game from a chess grandmaster. 
  Grandmasters are always very obsessed with chess, so honestly, I do not know what to show him in the house, because in my house, there is only one chess board, and I have no chess books in my house after all. Despite the fact that I have nothing much to show him in my house, I will let him recommend some chess books for intermediate players.
  This is all I will do. What will you do if Magnus Carlsen came to your house?

Essay 272:
The famous person that will come to my house is Newton. He was a famous mathmatician that knew that Earth has gravity.If he is coming to my house, I will show him all my technology to him and that includes my computers and my iPads. He probably had not see this before. Then, I will tell him about my televisions and how they work. I will also tell him about Chinese caligraphy. It was just writing beautiful characters with a kind of "brush pen". Maybe he wanted to try it.

I'm not only telling him my technologies, I'm also telling him about astronomy. For example, Pluto was a planet that was the farthest of all the 8 planets, which included Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Next, I will tell him about heliocentrism. It is about the Sun in the centre in the Solar System. And a astronomer called Galileo prevented evidence for it.

What a nice talk with Newton! I hope I can see him again in the future!

Essay 277:
Nowadays, plastic bags almost can be seen everywhere. It does make people's life convenient, but it is also a harm to the environment. We all know that plastic will be left in the environment for a long period, in which we want less production of plastic for sure. I strongly believe that protecting the environment is the responsibility for everyone. In order to achieve this goal, starting from small actions, plastic bags should be banned at our school. Plastic bags are actually not necessary in our daily life, because we have gotten many other choices. For example, they can be substituded by cloth bags. Many supermarkets have already banned plastic bags in recent years. Parents and teachers always tell us to care about the environment. If banning plastic bags does contribute to that, then why not just do whatever we can, and help the world to get better? Again, we have a lot of ways to reduce the use of plastic bags. Using a cloth bag or even a backpack instead of plastic bags will be a better option. I know everyone of us in the school is taught to be kind and caring, so please support the idea of banning plastic bags at school. 

Essay 278:
In these few decades, it has become more common in stores such as markets to stop using plastic bags. In my opinion, banning plastic bags has more good effects than negative effects. The benefits of banning plastic bags include less waste that harms the environment and positive effects on our health. Therefore, I support the idea of banning plastic bags, and even at our school, plastic bags should be banned. 

In the past, humans have prioritized convenience than the enviornment, so large amounts of plastic products such as plastic bags are manufactured. These plastic can create an enviormental hazard and lead to many negative effects to the wildlife. This is because plastic is known for being unbiodegradable, it is difficult for humans to recycle these plastic. As a result, much of the plastic is thrown into the ocean, forest, rivers, etc. When these plstic end up in the environment, many animals such as sea turtles and fish would mistake them as food and swallow them. Plastic can not be digested, so if plastic end up in an animals' internal systems, it has a large chance of killing them.

Another reason why plastic bags should not be used is that it creates harm not only to animals, it also creates health issues for humans too. As said above, when fish consumes these plastic and gets into their internal system, it cannot be digested. Thus, if the animal continues to live after consuming plastic, it would be stuck in its internal systems. Later, if the fish is caught by fisherman and later is eaten by people, the plastic would also makes its way into our stomach and intestines, which is bad for our health. Furthermore, petrol is an essential material used to produce plastic. During this process of manufacturing plastic products, much of the waste is released into the air. When humans breath this pollution into our lungs, it also creates many health problems such as cancer. 

Lastly, this is not to say that we should never use plastic bags. Since plastic bags are very durable, it makes it a perfect bag to be easily reused. For example, if a mother goes to the market everyday and uses a new plastic bag, there would be a large amount of plastic bags produced to meet the usage demands. However, if the mother reuses the plastic bag and ends up only using two or three plastic bags throughout the year, then there would be very plstic bags produced. This would be much better for the enviornment. 

In conclusion, places such as schools and supermarkets should stop giving out plastic bags because it creates harm to the environment, including wildlife, and other negative health effects on us humans. Because plastic bags can be easily reused, each person should bring their own bags to carry items.

Essay 280:
It's a quiet satuday morning when the silence is shattered by the ring of a doorbell. Startled, I rush to the door and hastily open it... And I see a celebrity. She has the same picture-perfect face, glossy hair and slender figure that's been shown in countless beauty magazines, movies, and TV shows. I remember watching her winnning prizes for her acting and being nominated "best actress of the year" through my TV. I awkwardly open the door with an unsure "hello..." that trails off near the end. I have no idea how to react, what to say, or what to do. Do I ask for an autograph? A photo? Do I invite her in? In the end, I settle with the last option, and I gesture towards the living room. She walks in lightly, each step purposeful, as if my house is her personal catwalk.
Though highly unlikely, if I were faced with such a scenario, I know that my mind would go blank. It's so easy to think of things to say, things to ask, and things to do when you're not seeing a famous person face-to-face, but even just imagining this scenario, I can realize that it's not easy to act coolly around someone that's obviously so much cooler than you. Being on the introverted side, I think I would stammer and stumble over my words at the beginning, until I get used to the feeling of having a superstar less than a few meters away from me. However, I know that once I gain the courage, my curiosity will talke over and I'll ask an endless stream of questions, starting with "what's the first thing that's important to be successful at something?" to, naturally, "can I have an autograph?". I'd ask them who they think influenced them the most, what words they'd use to describe themselves, what they're greatest strengths and weaknesses are, what advice they have for someone who aspires to be like them, and not being able to resist, whether they prefer cats or dogs.
Compared to thinking of what I'd ask a famous person, I had a much easier time deciding what I'd show them. Firstly, I'd take the celebrity to my room, which I take quite some pride in. I'd take them to the nook under my bunk bed with the soft yellow lights, beanbags, and shelves of books, show them my collection of cactuses and plants, and doubtlessly, show them my pet cat.

In addition, some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags. Therefore, I strongly believe, we should ban plastic bags in our schools.
  Firstly, Plastic bags are not only containers but also weapons to kill individuals.Plastic bags are very conveniet things that people will carry,but it is very difficult to break down.

As the technology developes, people do not bother to reuse, instead, more disposable items are produced such as plastic bags. However, as they are convenient, more supermarkets around the world decide to ban them because of their damage to the environment and human society. I strongly believe that our school should ban the use of plastic bags.

To begin with, plastic is extremely harmful to the soil. This poisonous material takes hundreds of years to be totally disolved in nature. In these years, tiny pieces of plastic can be mixed into the earth, and cause negative chemical reactions. As a result, the soil in particular areas will be less fertile and in bad condition for crops. For instance, human agriculture will be largely affected. This is a serious threat to all species, from tiny insects to large mammals.

In addition, human health can also be in danger because of this material. Since it cannot be disolved, disposed pieces of plastic eaten by microbes in the ocean, can be brought up from the bottom of the food chain to our stomach. After years of saving these tiny pieces in our body, our organs will be seriously damaged by the chemical material.

In conclusion, this threat is surrounding us in our daily life, the best way to avoid it hurting more peolpe, living things and our environment, is to ban it. Save our environment.

Essay 289:
For a long time, plastic bag was part of our daily life. It helps us a lot and we use it in various way. However, some research indicate that plastic bag has serious pollution, which is ture. Therefore, some supermarkets, from different courtries, generally banned plastic bags. From my perspective, I strongly believe that we should stop using plastic bags in our school. 

To begin with, plastic bag might pollute our school. Some research suggest that plastic bag is hard to dissolve. If we lose some plastic bag in soild, it needs to take a hundred years to resolve it. However, there is not a suitable way to recycle or deal with it. Unforturnately, we use huge amount of plastic bags in daily life, which means that plastic bags are easy to become pollution. 

On the other hand, we are more likely to waste plastic bags. We could see that plastic bags are easy to be destructed. It is hard to use one plastic bag for several times. In this case, we have to buy a large amount of platsic bags just for several times shopping. 

Addmittedly, plastic bag helps us in many ways. It is not only cheap for people, but also useful. However, we could use bags that are made by recycling materials. After all, I still suggest students to ban plastic bag in our school. Maybe one person's contribution is small, but together, our contribution will not be ingnored.

Ban Plastic Bags!

Using plastic bags when grocery shopping or buying food is very convient as you don't have to bring your own reusable market bag. However have you ever thought about how harmful plastic bags can be to the environment? In this article, I will be sharing my opinions on why banning plastic bags in our school is important.

Plastic, in general can take up to 1000 years to decompose. It is very harmful to the environment because even after it decompose, there would still be a lot of toxic particles from it. If animals accidently ingest them, they might die or have long-term health issues. This might potentially harm the ecosystem too. 

Moreover, if plastic bags are disposed incorrectly and are thrown into the ocean, it can harm the aquatic life. Studies in the US shows that every year, about 300 billion plastic bags are ended in the ocean. Imagine how how your living environment would be like if your home is invaded by tons of plastic bags. Horrible!

Lastly, recycling plastic bags are extremely difficult. The reason for that is because plastics are made up of serveral types of polymers, and meltng them together makes it so difficult and close to impossible to recycle. 

I understand that we can sometimes be forgetful, so to make it easier for everyone, our school should consider using paper bags intead. Paper bags are much more environmental friendly and it is as convinient as using a plastic bag. 

I hope that you understand the importance of banning plastic bags in our school. One small step can change the entire world.
