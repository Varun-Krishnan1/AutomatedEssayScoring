Essay 181:
Plastic bags should be banned at our school
Nowadays,more and more supermarkets in Australia begin to ban plastic bags.They use paper bags that can be recycled to replace the plastic bags.As we are Australian students ,I think our school should also stop using the plastic bags ,because those bags are harmful to the environment and not as strong as our own clothe bag.
Firstly,plastic bags have a bad effort on the environment.Sea pollution is very seiourly now,one of the reasons that cause sea pollution is plastic bags.We use them and throw them into the rubbish bin,howvever,it is very hard for goverment to deal with those white rubbish.The governments of some countries chose to leave them in the sea., so sea pollution happened.Some goverments burn the plastic bags in order to clean them quickly.It's even worse to the enviroment,the black smoke that is proudced by the burning plastic bags can pollute the air.If we don't stop such action ,we may can't breathe after ten years.
Secondly,plastic bags are not as strong as our own clothe bags.Bring your own bags can not only save some money but also prevent some  embarress things happen.For example,we buy a plastic whitch is not very strong,
IN colustion,I think plastic bags should be banned at our school.

 

Essay 182:
There are a lot of things to give up as a celebrity, such as time, energy, sleep, and much more. But for their personal life, I really think that it is unreasonable to expect all celebrities to give up their personal life as they are still humans, they are just same as us. Celebrities have to spend time and energy not only to satisfy the audience, but to spend time doing what they want to do outside of celebrity things.
Firstly, all celebrities have families and friends, just like we do. If we were a celebrity we would want to take some time off and spend time with our loved ones and our friends. And if celebrities don't interact with their friends and families, they might worry about the whereabouts of the celebrities. which is the last thing their families and friends want to happen. Celebrities would also love to know about the conditions that their families are at, the last thing they want might also be not able to connect with their families. A lot of celebrities would rather give up their careers just to spend more time with their families and friends.
Secondly, celebrities also have hobbies outside of maybe making a movie or playing sport competitions. For example, a professional basketball player, Wardell Stephen Curry, also loves playing golf and is often times spotted playing golf with his family and friends. Celebrities would also need time to rest and catch on to the real world and about what's happening outside of the celebrity world.
Although celebrities must have time to do things other than their duties, they must not neglect what the audience wants. They should also priorities their time and energy on how much they spend on the audience and their own personal life. They should fulfil the audiences wishes to an extent or have a limit to what they should do or what they shouldn't based on the celebritiy's morality. There isn't really a straight line on weather or not listening to the public about this or that is right or wrong. But there has to be a "bottom line" to everything that they do or don't do.
To wrap this up. In my opinion, there is no straight answer to weather giving up their personal life is good or bad, but obviously they'll have to consider a bit about their personal life. It's mostly just if the celebrity is happy and having a wonderful time.

Essay 183:
Nowadays , people love shooping so much they just can't help doing it,while shopping,people often wastes a lot of plastic bags , and that caused a lot of harm to the environment.
Because of that , some supermarkets in number of countries have banned plastic bags.I think our school shall ban plastic bags for the environment as well.
There are a few reasons of why we shall ban plastic bags.First,plastic bags cannot be reused.When they are used one or two times , most of the people will choose to throw them away,and get a new one,that produces a large amount of trash that will cause harm to the environment.Its not environmentally friendly.Second , some of the careless students may throw them on the corridor or in the classrooms.Plastic bags are quite slippery , the plastic bags on the walkway may trip someone or cause an accident.We don't want that to happen and cause harm to students or teachers.At last , plastic bags are hard to dissolve , if it was disposed into the nature,it will take hundreds of years to dissolve.If a large amount of plastic bags are disposed,it may even affect the food chain,at last,humans will pay for what they have done.
Somebody may asked,'What can we use to replace plastic bags?'The best solution is for students or teachers to bring their own bags to school.The other solution is to replace plastic bags with paper bags . Plastic bags cannot be reused as well as paper bags,but paper bags are easier to dissolve and its harmless for most of the animals.Its not the perfect solution but I think it will cause less harm to humanbeings and the environment.
I hope our school and students can take action after reading my article,for the sake of the environment and most importantly,for ourselves.

Essay 187:
I love winter and it's my favorite. I like summer too but not too much. The summer weather is very hot and it could fry an egg. But we can go on holiday, go shopping or go to the beach. The weather in winter in the morning is quite cold but at the night we have to wear very thick shirts. Winter is my favorite season because I love cold weather. We can eat hot food or even go on a trip with our family. Sometimes, during the snowfall, we can build a snowman, throw snowballs at each other, and have a lot of fun games we can make. 

Essay 188:
  A person knocked on my door. Slowly, I opened the entrance. A man with black, curly hair stepped forward, his big eyes stared into mine,  and his skinny hands reached forward -- Hanyu Yuzuru! He is the champion of many Olympic games, and the gold medals reflect rays of sunlight that pierced my eyes. "Hello! I never thought you would come! My mom made some cookies. Quick, come inside." I said happily as he stepped into my house. He's famous for his ice skating skills. He's also great at studying, and he continuously calculates the time or angle that is best for landing and how to improve his skills. My mom always says that my sister and I should learn from him -- be determined just like he always wants to jump a 4A on the Olympics ( jumping and spinning four and a half time, no one had ever tried this before.) That is why I'm be so excited to meet him. I also asked him how to be so determined on a specific thing and why he chose to ice skate in the first place. After all these questions, I showed him our house. First, my sister's room, especially the little doll she made of Hanyu. Then, he followed me to the garage, where a wooden structure of him sits. He's pleased to see these things and claims we are all good at crafting. When it was time to leave, we said goodbye and waved at him as his shadow slowly disappeared in the distance......

Essay 189:
     The door creaks open, numerous shreaks arise from my lungs as a strange yet familiar person sets foot into the house. This scene will be played when a famous person comes to my home, and most likely, she will be a figure skating athlete; or even better, an olympic medalist. If such dreams are to come true, the visitor should feel delighted after the visit, as everything has already been planned through my imaginations: the witness of her beauty, the dialogue between us, and even the tour around the house.
    As she enters the room, she shall be wearing daily clothes in which usual teenagers wear, unlike those dresses which were worn for competition. Since she's an athlete, she wouldn't be extroadinarily tall, but is rather around the average height. She will look rather muscular but soft within, and walk gracefully through the doors, glancing around the house. She is famous since she got a medal in the Olympics, proving her ability as an athlete, but also rising her fame among people. Another reason would be that she skates gorgeously and is extremely eye catching, causing more people to become interested in her as well as to like her. With these backgrounds, she had became a considerably famous person around the globe.
     I should greet her and bow in respect, showing my admiration towards her. She too would smile and convey her appreciation of my support. I then will tell her my love in the sport of figure skating and probably ask for professional advices, since this is a crucial and unique chance in my life. Later, it would be entertaining to sit down and ask some questions about her own experiences and progress in iceskating during her childhood if it's available.
     Finally, bringing her onto a tour of the house is similarly critical, as it can deepen her understanding of me as well as bring more interest into the visit. If I had the chance, I will show her some pictures of her in my room to demonstrate her importance towards me. I will also show her some of my own hobbies and introduce her some of my favorite books, in order to connect more with her. Other unimportant small things may be shared as well to build a tighter bond between us and to create a warming atmostphere for this visit.
     With all these plans illustrated above, it will be a successful tour in the house and an exciting experience for the visitor as well.

Essay 191:
When was the last time that you used a platic bag? Actually, the most normal answer of the question above is yesterday. It's because we live in a world which develops rapidly. However, it's necessary for people to stop using the plastic bag since it has absolutely negative effects to the environment. 

The most essential environmental issue of the plastic bag is that it decays extremely slow. Indeed, plastic bags need to take more than two years to accomplish decaying. Hence, people should use other methods, which also hurt our environment to help plastic bags to decay. For instance, scientists in my country suggest to collect plastic bags and burn them. It seems like a useful way because the speed of buring is quick, while the carbon dioxide and other chemical things produced from burning bring huge impact to the environment, which caused the air of my country becomes not as fresh as before.

In addition, more demands for this kind of bag accelerate unpleasant influences of the plastic bag. I believe that all of you have heard about the news that shows the accumlation of plastic bags everywhere, especially in the ocean. Needless to say, the population of organisms which live in the ocean will decrease when there are tons of garbage like plastic bags in there. Then, the amount of marine food that we eat becomes less and the quality of the water we use and drink becomes bad.

Due to lots of disadvantages of the plastic bag, it's important for us to ban the plastic bag and find other bags to replace it. There are two advisable ways that we can follow to protect our world. Firstly, we can use some environmental friendly bags which are made by wood or other natural materials. Secondly, we can purchase one plastic bag, and always use it until it breaks. In conclusion, let's stop using plastic bags in order to help our environment

Essay 193:
Mobile phones. An invention that has improved billions of people's life quality by making communication way easier than what we had 4 decades ago. But with such advantage comes a lot of disadvanteges such as spending less time outside.etc. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages that comes with such easy communication.
Firstly, mobile phones can improve relationships with our family, reletives and friends. Back before mobile phones were a thing, family members are seperated during working hours and weren't able to chat with each others and they had to wait untill they're home to be even able to greet. But now, we can talk to each other with just a fews of a button. We can know more about our own family and understand the work environment of each other. Which can make the already strong bond in the family even stronger with ease. 
Secondly, parents won't have to worry too much as their kids have phones, they can call their parents in an emergency or call for help if they are in danger. Friends will also fell better to know that they can communicate with their friends easily. Friends can also plan a meetup online instead of having the need to meet up in person just to plan when to eat lunch together.
But with all the advantages and happiness. There also has a disadvantage to having the ability to communicate easily. For a lot of teenagers, they might lose the will to meet their friends in person since they can call their friends or chat with them in messaging apps without even leaving their bed. This will for sure ruin their mental health and physical health for not going outside. Which will cause teens to feel as if they are useless in the outside world as the world functions normally without them even stepping outside of their room. This will make them feel depressed and sad, as they start to make themselves only look at the bad side of things and not try to find a way out as they can always escape the real world through the online world.
But in my opinion. As long as we use our mobile phone in the right way and that we can impact ourselves or others for the better, it's a wonderful invention.

Essay 196:
Happy. A feeling that a lot of teenagers might think has abandoned them and are longing to have the same feeling of going to the beach for the first time. You might think that you've grown too old for happiness to flow into your life. But don't worry, here you can find advices to regain the happiness that you thought you've lost from a teenager who is enjoying his life and is happy about his current situation.
Firstly. Enjoy everything at it's fullest and get the most out of everything. When you're doing the things that you love, rather it's going out with friends. You might often come across times when you think happy times are often short and they aren't worth having as they're so short. Everything has an end, and it happens with both happy and sad times. Remeber, it's rather you've enjoyed it or learned anything from it. So when you notice that you're having the short and happy times, remember to enjoy every second of it and treasure every moment of it. Be happy it happened, don't be sad it ended.
Secondly. Don't overthink about the accidents or mistakes you've caused or made. I myself have came across mistakes or accidents that I didn't want to happen. Back then I would cry myself to bed after a little mistake I made and overthink about it for days. One day I was tired of this and I wanted to feel happier and worry less. So on that day onwards, I told myself that i have to learn from my mistakes and try to prevent that from happening ever again. Mistakes were meant to make and as long as you don't redo the same mistake and are really sorry for your actions, it's alright. Everything is worth learning from and most importantly, learn from your mistakes try your best to prevent it.
