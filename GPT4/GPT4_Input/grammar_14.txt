Essay 261:
  Plastic bags are known and used worldwide for their convenience and versatility. They are easily stored, used, produced, and are non-toxic to use on most occasions. Despite their countless advantages, they also bring long-term dangers to the world, such as air pollution, sea pollution, land pollution. I strongly believe that their disadvantages vehemently outweigh their advantages and that we should take action to reduce the use of plastic bags in our school.

  First and foremost, plastic bags contributes to the worsening of air pollution when being produced in large scale productions. In order to produce plastic bags, factories undergo different processes, and one of the major processes is heating. However, heating releases a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, which is the cause of global warming. Moreover, the different processes might produce toxic gases, which are harmful to society and animals.

  When plastic bags enter the sea, it leads to sea pollution. We odten see cases of sea creatures accidentally eating these plastic bags. However, they can not digest it or the chemicals in the plastic bag might be toxic for them, causing numerous deaths of the sea creatures and an imbalance in the ecosystem.

  Thirdly, plastic bags contains chemicals that are extremely hard to decompose. They do not decompose even after hundreds of years. This phenomenon adds up to landfill pollution, and affects the world long-term.

  By reducing the use of plastic bags, we can help change the world for the better. It decreases the rate of pollution and climate change worsening and provides a clean, safer, more hygenic earth for the future generations. Hence, we as students, should take action and not use plastic bags at school anymore.

Essay 262:
Hello fellow students and teachers, around the world, we have experienced many different changes with our world including the vast technology advancement through cars, phones and even different travel methods from areas that we never thought will be possible a hundred years ago. However, the many benefits that came from the advancement of human society has also had its drawbacks, climate change, decline in mental health, and the use of harmful objects that indirectly affect the planet such as plastic. In this article, I would be explaining why we should be banning plastic bags in our prosperous school.

First and foremost, plastic bags are extremely difficult to decompose safely. Most things around the world decompose and give back the energy to the soil beneath our feet, plastic bags on the other hand dont decompose after many unreal circumstances, like being eaten, being left to rot and even being burnt up into flames. All three methods of decomposition is detrimental to the environment. Letting the plastic being eaten by other animals would most likely strangle the animal or make it stay inside the animal killing them slowly, if it were to be captured by food hawlers, the animal that ate it would be served to some of us which would indirectly mean that we are eating plastic. Leaving it to rot on the other hand would take years to decompose and would likely damage all of the surrounding environment and all of this would be for a one time use of convienience. After the first two options, burning plastic would seem to be the most optimum way to get rid of plastic. However this might be the most dangerous way to get rid of plastic. Not only plastic is extremely durable, many plastic particles is light enough to blend into the air around us which would mean that we would be breathing plastic. 

Secondly, plastic waste has been used all around the world and millions of tonnes of plastic is sent to the landfill every year. According to a variety of different sources, it is stated that there have been over 400 million tonnes of plastic waste each year around the globe. As a school, we could be contributing to the cause by the many tonnes of plastic waste that we produce every day like packing food, using them as bottles and much more. We as a school could produce over 1000 tonnes of plastic waste alone per year. This number should not be allowed to rise any further as this issue could be stopped if we were to ban the entire school from using plastic. 

In conclusion, if the entire school were to completely stop the use of plastics in general, we could contribute to slowing down the crisis of climate change and help protect the environment better. With our the luxury of learning about this topic, lets all rise against plastic usage and protect the earth from climate change together.

Essay 268:
Dear Radio Daily,

The competition was based upon the community voting for the most voted music or art piece within a month. However, I believe I should be the winner of the music category. All the free chocolate within the prize has also made me hungry for success which led me to write to Radio Daily, about why I should be the winner of the music category.

The music I produced had been in the works even before the competition even started. Looking at my passion for music, I understood that writing a song that had a backstory and meaning to it would be a very difficult task and would need much care in the studio to perfectly craft a masterpiece which is music. Fortifying my script with other music artists' consideration, without a shadow of a doubt could be the next big hit when it drops down.

Coming out of Yale School of Music with a Bachelor's degree, I believe that I would be more than qualified to differentiate the difference between a well-written song and a rushed song.  Yale School of Music was not an easy task as I dropped almost every part of my academic freedom and placed it in a risky industry. The world of music is a vast one and I studied hard to get first-class honors in my year group. Studying the culture of music has given me the inspiration to write my songs and hopefully become an artist one day my starting point is winning this competition. 

Knowing the prize is a one-year supply of chocolate, there could be an extensive list of ideas of what I could do with it. Eating all of the chocolate would not be the smartest choice as it could leave me in a much worse place which could make me have an addiction to chocolate. Instead, I would be thinking about using the chocolate for good and giving them out to the less fortunate. Not only would it be easier for the load to not be wasted, but could also help with my personal reputation and my love for the community. I would also keep some for myself to eat and maybe bake some cake if I find the time to. 

To conclude my statement, the music competition will not only be a great start to my career but would also be a delicious treat for the community.

Thank you for your time,
Christopher

  For this essay, I will imagine that the world chess champion Magnus Carlsen comes to my home. He is neither tall nor short, has short hair and a very cleanly shaved beard, and does not wear any glasses (despite having played a lot of chess). He is famous because, well, he is the world chess champion.
  If he comes to my home, I would say: "Hello, may I have just one chess game with you now?" By his nature, he will say yes, of course. After that, I will film the whole chess game to post it on Youtube sometime later. Sometimes, chess grandmasters will play some very strange openings to most people, so I will let him explain what openings were played in that game. I'd also like to make progress in chess, so I will talk to him during the game to gather ideas for the game from a chess grandmaster. 
  Grandmasters are always very obsessed with chess, so honestly, I do not know what to show him in the house, because in my house, there is only one chess board, and I have no chess books in my house after all. Despite the fact that I have nothing much to show him in my house, I will let him recommend some chess books for intermediate players.
  This is all I will do. What will you do if Magnus Carlsen came to your house?

Essay 272:
The famous person that will come to my house is Newton. He was a famous mathmatician that knew that Earth has gravity.If he is coming to my house, I will show him all my technology to him and that includes my computers and my iPads. He probably had not see this before. Then, I will tell him about my televisions and how they work. I will also tell him about Chinese caligraphy. It was just writing beautiful characters with a kind of "brush pen". Maybe he wanted to try it.

I'm not only telling him my technologies, I'm also telling him about astronomy. For example, Pluto was a planet that was the farthest of all the 8 planets, which included Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Next, I will tell him about heliocentrism. It is about the Sun in the centre in the Solar System. And a astronomer called Galileo prevented evidence for it.

What a nice talk with Newton! I hope I can see him again in the future!

Essay 277:
Nowadays, plastic bags almost can be seen everywhere. It does make people's life convenient, but it is also a harm to the environment. We all know that plastic will be left in the environment for a long period, in which we want less production of plastic for sure. I strongly believe that protecting the environment is the responsibility for everyone. In order to achieve this goal, starting from small actions, plastic bags should be banned at our school. Plastic bags are actually not necessary in our daily life, because we have gotten many other choices. For example, they can be substituded by cloth bags. Many supermarkets have already banned plastic bags in recent years. Parents and teachers always tell us to care about the environment. If banning plastic bags does contribute to that, then why not just do whatever we can, and help the world to get better? Again, we have a lot of ways to reduce the use of plastic bags. Using a cloth bag or even a backpack instead of plastic bags will be a better option. I know everyone of us in the school is taught to be kind and caring, so please support the idea of banning plastic bags at school. 

Essay 278:
In these few decades, it has become more common in stores such as markets to stop using plastic bags. In my opinion, banning plastic bags has more good effects than negative effects. The benefits of banning plastic bags include less waste that harms the environment and positive effects on our health. Therefore, I support the idea of banning plastic bags, and even at our school, plastic bags should be banned. 

In the past, humans have prioritized convenience than the enviornment, so large amounts of plastic products such as plastic bags are manufactured. These plastic can create an enviormental hazard and lead to many negative effects to the wildlife. This is because plastic is known for being unbiodegradable, it is difficult for humans to recycle these plastic. As a result, much of the plastic is thrown into the ocean, forest, rivers, etc. When these plstic end up in the environment, many animals such as sea turtles and fish would mistake them as food and swallow them. Plastic can not be digested, so if plastic end up in an animals' internal systems, it has a large chance of killing them.

Another reason why plastic bags should not be used is that it creates harm not only to animals, it also creates health issues for humans too. As said above, when fish consumes these plastic and gets into their internal system, it cannot be digested. Thus, if the animal continues to live after consuming plastic, it would be stuck in its internal systems. Later, if the fish is caught by fisherman and later is eaten by people, the plastic would also makes its way into our stomach and intestines, which is bad for our health. Furthermore, petrol is an essential material used to produce plastic. During this process of manufacturing plastic products, much of the waste is released into the air. When humans breath this pollution into our lungs, it also creates many health problems such as cancer. 

Lastly, this is not to say that we should never use plastic bags. Since plastic bags are very durable, it makes it a perfect bag to be easily reused. For example, if a mother goes to the market everyday and uses a new plastic bag, there would be a large amount of plastic bags produced to meet the usage demands. However, if the mother reuses the plastic bag and ends up only using two or three plastic bags throughout the year, then there would be very plstic bags produced. This would be much better for the enviornment. 

In conclusion, places such as schools and supermarkets should stop giving out plastic bags because it creates harm to the environment, including wildlife, and other negative health effects on us humans. Because plastic bags can be easily reused, each person should bring their own bags to carry items.

Essay 280:
It's a quiet satuday morning when the silence is shattered by the ring of a doorbell. Startled, I rush to the door and hastily open it... And I see a celebrity. She has the same picture-perfect face, glossy hair and slender figure that's been shown in countless beauty magazines, movies, and TV shows. I remember watching her winnning prizes for her acting and being nominated "best actress of the year" through my TV. I awkwardly open the door with an unsure "hello..." that trails off near the end. I have no idea how to react, what to say, or what to do. Do I ask for an autograph? A photo? Do I invite her in? In the end, I settle with the last option, and I gesture towards the living room. She walks in lightly, each step purposeful, as if my house is her personal catwalk.
Though highly unlikely, if I were faced with such a scenario, I know that my mind would go blank. It's so easy to think of things to say, things to ask, and things to do when you're not seeing a famous person face-to-face, but even just imagining this scenario, I can realize that it's not easy to act coolly around someone that's obviously so much cooler than you. Being on the introverted side, I think I would stammer and stumble over my words at the beginning, until I get used to the feeling of having a superstar less than a few meters away from me. However, I know that once I gain the courage, my curiosity will talke over and I'll ask an endless stream of questions, starting with "what's the first thing that's important to be successful at something?" to, naturally, "can I have an autograph?". I'd ask them who they think influenced them the most, what words they'd use to describe themselves, what they're greatest strengths and weaknesses are, what advice they have for someone who aspires to be like them, and not being able to resist, whether they prefer cats or dogs.
Compared to thinking of what I'd ask a famous person, I had a much easier time deciding what I'd show them. Firstly, I'd take the celebrity to my room, which I take quite some pride in. I'd take them to the nook under my bunk bed with the soft yellow lights, beanbags, and shelves of books, show them my collection of cactuses and plants, and doubtlessly, show them my pet cat.
I'm still unsure of
