Essay 161:
I come home after class, really tired. However, I discover my mom is wearing a strange facial expression and she says," someone is coming to our house. You will scream when you see!" 
Opening the door with some confusement and some excitement, I see a very familiar shadow, tall and thin. "No way... Are you...Hanyu Yuzuru?" The person turns around, which makes me scream loudly,"God! I cannot believe my eyes!"
Hanyu Yuzuru is one of the most famous and legendary ice skater around the world, with countless honors and records throughout his life as an athlete. He became exdroadinarily well-known after the Beijing Winter Olympic Game. His appearence, proffesional skills and the attitude toward ice skating and everyone around him gained him a huge population of fans in different countries.
Hanyu smiles at me. I run in front of him, saying," I am a fan of you for many years. I have so many things I want to tell you, but...but I cannot calm my mind. First of all, congradualations to you for becoming a professional ice skating perfomer and please continue to skate for yourself and the expectations of fans. Umm...I don't know what I want to say. Here, please allow me to show my room to you!"  Looking at him closely, I discover that he is much more skinny andeven taller comparing to his photos. He can even be compared as a chopstick, wearing a normal T-shirt.
I lead him into my room and says, " I bought and created a lot of things related to you. Here is a photobook from Japan, some photos I printed out, your biography, and look! This is a picture I drew that included all the performances you presented through the 20 years. That costs a lot of my effort!"

Essay 162:
  Have you ever seen some strange animal? If yes, which one do you think is the strangest? For me, the strangest animal I have seen is octopus. They live in the sea and they look totally different from most of the marine species. The most obvious example is that they have eight legs that full of suckers. Also, their body are able to pass through a tiny seam and the minimum size of the seam depends on how big their mouth is. It is because their hole body are soft and flexible except their mouth. 
  The reason why I think octopus is the strangest animal I have ever seen is that they are very intelligent. Their IQ are as same as a little child which is very top in animalia. Moreover, they are very good at escape. For example, if they are caught by the fishermen, they will keep on looking for a gap that allow them to escape. Last but not least, they have a talent for imitating others' action. There is a experiment that talks about this ability. In the experiment, the octopus will be blocked in a jar. Then a man show it how to open the jar in another room. After a while, that octopus opened the jar in a same way as the man's did. This shows that they have tha ability on imitating others' action.
  Octopus is really an interesting and intelligent animal and thats the reason why I think it is the stangerest animal I have ever seen.

He is very young and still has a long way to go but he decides to save people as a hero instead of having a normal teenage life like other teenagers, that's why i really admire him.

The second reason is that plastic bags may cause our school very dirty.The plastic bags are very cheap.When students buy something in the supermarket,they can pay more one yuan and get a plastic bag.So they aiways don't care their plastic bags.They may let the plastic bags fiutter around our beautiful school.

Essay 168:
Nowdays, the recycling process of plastic became a problem to human. So people had a heated debate about whether plastic bags should be banned. In my opinion, plastic bags should not be sold and students should not to use it anytime anywhere. 

Firstly, plastic bags are harmful to the environment. Plastic is a material that not human but also nature can not recycle. If people burn the plastic garbages, the gases that they made can kill lots of people all over the world. Also, these litter will pollute soil if human put them under ground. For example, the scientists went to the north face of Earth to burn plastics to find the solution of the plastic problem. however, we had not find the best way to deal with it. So, plastic bags are harmful to the environment and Earth.

Moreover, using plastic bags form a bad habit to people. Everyone should be prepared before they want to do something. However, people will not prepare a bag before shopping if the supermarkets provide plastic bags, that will lead to a bad atmosphere of the society. 

Lastly, using plastic bags may lead to many problems even wars between countries. For example, Japan had put the polluted water to the ocean and many countries are angry with Japan's action. That is because that Japan polluted the Earth. As a result, using plastic bags may be a problem between countries. 

So, we should not using plastic bags angmore so that our Earth will be more pretty.

Essay 169:
Dear students,
  It might have come to your attention, that in recent years, supermarkets reduced the use of plastic bags. Plastic bags are successful and beneficial intentions, they are convenient and easy to produce. As a result, it is confusing to see plastic bags getting banned. However, I totally agree with the 'supermarket policy'.
  To commence with, plastic bags are damaging to the environment. The reason is that plastic bags are made of plastics, making them hard to dissolve. Once you throw it away,  the only way to deal with it is to bury it in the soil. As a consequence, the plastic bag remains there for decades, then ends up with harmful chemicals. The plants there are not able to grow, and the herbs do not have food to eat. A little plastic bag can cause an unchangeable disaster to the environment.
  Further, as you can see on TikTok, YouTube, and in newspapers. Lots of animals died because they mistakenly ate plastic items or were unable to breathe because of a plastic bag stuck in their mouths. pitiful and unbearable news comes one by one. If you still pay little attention to the horrible results that humans made by just a small mistake. The earth will be surrounded by plastic bags. And the next who would be killed by plastic bags might be human lives.
  From all the above, this is what I strongly support for the ban on plastic bags. Not only I should do it, but also my dearest classmates that I have seen and greeted on every beautiful morning thanks to the gorgeous environment. I implore you, to stop using plastic bags instead of reusable bags. It takes step by step to bring back the lovely home for the species killed by light and small plastic bags. It starts with you and me. Please stop using plastic bags at school and elsewhere. By doing so, we are contributing to a better world.
