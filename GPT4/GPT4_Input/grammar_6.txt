Essay 103:
Nowadays, there has been an increasing trend of awareness towards outer-space species, which means there has also been an decreasing attention towards animals or living creatures on earth. I will be discusing strangest animal I have seen-kangaroos

To initiate with, the first time I saw kangaroos was on TV. they have the heads that is similar to deers but without horns. The strangest part of their body is 'sleeping bag' that is grown on their stomach part. They also have muscular legs which helps them with their movements. Secondly, most kangaroos habitats' are in  Australia, the 'down under' with strong beam from the sun. Thus the colour of their fur looks light brown. Lastly, in comparison with other animals, kangaroos not only have their 'pocket' on their body, but also have strange techniques of combat, similar to boxing.

As a conclusion, a strange animal are needed to be different, whether it be appearence or the way they fight. From my perspective, kangaroos can verify those factors I just mentioned.

Essay 106:
Yesterday was the best day of my life! I was just about to leave for my piano lesson when I saw a man sitting down on our living room couch. I couldn't really tell who he was at first because all i could see was the back of his head. He had short, dark hair.  He was very well dressed. He was wearing a brown leathered jacket over a white T-shirt.  I think he could sense my presence because right when I was examining him, he turned his head around to look at me. My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe my eyes. I never thought this day would come. I pinched myself a couple of times. It was Tom Holland! My all time favourite movie star. He plays the character spiderman. My number one super hero. Just then, my brother came out of the kitchen with a couple of drinks. My brother noticed how confused I looked and instantly introduced me to Tom Holland and told him that I was his biggest fan. I was embarassed but also thrilled at the same time. Tom greeted me with a warm smile. I immediately felt butterflies in my stomach. I told him I had already watched every single one of his movies at least three times. Then I started to ask him questions about his experience filming the latest spiderman movie. He was a very friendly and fun person to talk to. I enjoyed every second of our conversation. I finally decided to show Tom my favourite part of the house: my room. Reason being, every corner of my room is covered with posters of spiderman. And I also

Essay 107:
In our world today plastic bags have been an important product for every human being on the planet. It is easy to produce, cost cheap, and have a variety of uses, but nothing is perfect so do plastic bags. It is an important factor causing global warming and pollution. Many supermarkets and countries around the world have banned plastic bags because of their damage to the environment. So I think our school should also apply this ban plastic bags. The first reason for this is that it could harm the school environment. School enviroment is a big part of not only the school but also the students, student won't be able to learn with a dirty and polluted environment. No one is going to promise that the students are going to reuse the plastic bag and recycle them properly. We are really familiar with the image of plastic things especially plastic bags on the side way of the street. The second reason is that the amount of plastic being produced will increase leading to pollution. Nowadays plastic bags have been around on a lot of stuff we could have seen them wrap around food that we eat every day. So if food in the cantin uses plastic bag to wrap and for the kids to carry this would cause a lot of plastic bags being produce since students in a school nowadays is not under 1000 kids per school. In conclusion, we should ban plastic bags in the school because of two reasons. The first reason is that it could harm the school environment, and the second reason is that it could make cause pollution, since that uses increase the production of plastic bags would increases.

Essay 108:
In recent years, some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags as an action to help the environment. Plastic bags sometimes are not neccesary, such as putting enclosed food in plastic bags. This increases the number of plastic bags which can be avoided, and plastic bags cause many enironmental problems. 

First of all, plastic bags take centries to be natrually degrade, which means they take ages to be dissolved by the environment. With the pace of our uses, most of the landfills will be full in under a decade, which leads to more landfills and more unuseable spaces. Other rubbish treatment is to burn them, but burning plastic produces greenhouse gas, making the serious global warming more serious. 

Secondly, not all people are well behaving that they just throw rubbish on the street or into the ocean. If they throw plastic bags on the, the area starts to get dirty, and this will increase the workload of cleaners. If they throw into the ocean, marin lifes may treat plastic bags as food, and they may eat them and causes diseaes due to their stomach full of plastic bags. They may also get trapped in plastic bags, which greatly affect their daily life.

Therefore, I believe that plastic bags should be banned at our school to help the enivronment. Plastic bags are not essential as there are lots of alternative, for example, frabic bags, backpack, or even our hands. If students have a habit of not using plastic bags, this will lower the number of plastic bags in the world by a tiny fraction. Although it doesn't seem a lot, we should still do our best to keep our mother nature healthy, for us and the next generations.

Dear Friend,

Did you know once, I have a very interesting dream about I am the only person left in the world. So what I did was, eat everything in the store and I can even get anything I want. Even though, I can have anything I want, I was pretty lonely I have no friends to played with no one to care for you, no one to cooked for you it is just really lonely there. I can only stay where I was because there was no one to drive for me so I couldn't travel anywhere.

After I woke up from that dream, everyone think that being the only person in the world was fun but it is actually really boring. Still being with your family and friends was still much more fun. Like now I am talking to you if you were all by yourself there will be no one to talked and played with. So you should spend time with them more so they don't felt lonely.

Essay 113:
  There are lots of superheroes that I really admires because of their abilites, skills and experiences. But out of all of them, there is a unique superhero that I likes the most. He is called by the Caped Baldy, Saitama.
  Saitama had a special bald head. He used to explained that it was because he worked out so hard that all of his hair had gotten fewer until he was bald. Saitama has an elastic, yellow suit because it stands out and easy for him to move. He also has some red gloves and a pair of heel with the same colour as the gloves just like most of the superheroes. The main thing that every superheroes will not want to miss is a cape. Saitama has a long, cream coloured cape that reaches until his ankle which represents him. His clothes are quite colourful which made him different than others.
  Saitama has a simple skill that anyone can do it. All he needs to do in most fights is to land a single, direct punch towards his opponents. There are three different types of punch that he uses, a soft punch, medium punch, and the serious punch. He will estimate his opponents' strength and decide what punch he should use. That's also the reason why the name of the series is called One Punch Man. 
  I really admires Saitama because he is a person that is hard working. He sometimes show others repects and he is funny. I likes the way he fights because it's really cool. Just imagine you blows your opponents out by just one punch.  I have mad respects for him. 
  Saitama remains to be one of my most favourite superheroes. He has a strong punch that can send you to an another world, funny and completely stands out in an interesting way.

The strangest animal I've seen was a koala. It is very unique with its chubby fingers like human's. They look very cute on the outside with grey furry body which can climb onto trees and hang on there for a long time. They are very interesting too since they're fingerprints are like humans. They're fingerprints and fingers are built so similar to humans. Koala's like to climb onto trees and stay there for a long time. Other animals cannot grip onto trees for so long that's because they so not have fingerprints and finger's like humans. Koala's have an advantage since they have such a unique and cute hand. Koal's also have two pairs of largae dark eyes which glows. They have large noise which allows them to find food and I think koala's are unique because they have figners built like humans and they are really cute. I love koala's a lot because of they're uniqueness.

Dear my friend,
I live in Hong Kong and I have been living there for 13 years. Hong Kong is a very well known and small city which tall buildings everywhere. Most people live in tall buildings. I live in an apartment in kowloon tong, Ho Man Tin. My home is on the 46 floor. My neighbores also lives in the same apartment where we get to communicate and chat with them easily since we live very close to each other. Hong Kong is different to other places since people usually live in tall buildings but the peope who live in other places live in houses and low apartments. Something I don't like about my area is that it is very small. ALl the citizens in Hong Kong are very close to each other which makes it so cramped. Sometimes the markets are really skinky and gross because people sell fish, meat and other food. The fish meat and the raw meat makes it disgutsing and disgusting and might make the floor a dirty. Thank you. Hope you have a great time!

Sincerely, Audrey.

Essay 119:
Banning plastic bags has been a debatable topic among the society and students. While some hold the belief that plastic is harmful to the environment and nature species, others still ignore its drawbacks. However, in order to improve human's life quality, it is crucial to take responsibility of using chemical products such as plastic bags.

First of all, plastic bags take a huge amount of time to fully disintergrate. In other words, if the bags are thrown into the ocean, they still appear there for decades. According to scientist, plastic is estimated to 450 years to be disappeared. Additionally, the mjority of the plastic bags would be dumped to the sea and ocean. Consequently, these bags not only contaminate ocean water, but also obstruct the marine animals. 

On top of that, some sea animals can onfuse between food and plastic bags. For instance, some fish and crabs were reported that they had a lot of small pieces of plastic bottles and bags, which stuck the digestion progress of the animals. Therefore, if we keep continue throwing plastic to the ocean, we would harm the sea animals and ourselves.

From these reasons, it is obvious that we should take the action of banning plastic seriously.
