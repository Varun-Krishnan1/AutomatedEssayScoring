Fellow students:

Recently, major institutions around the world have been advocated for environmental protection, calling for usage of recyclable materials. As an international citizen, I believe that we should contribute to this global movement. Therefore, I am offcially calling for the banning of plastic bag in our school for the sake of protecting the environment.

Firstly, using plastic bags causes huge burden to local trash-dealing institutions, as plastic is not biodegradable material. It generally takes more than two hundred years to degrade one plastic bag, which severely damage the soil condition and environmental resources. It is irresponsible to abuse the environment in this large extent. Also, for our posterity, they'll have to face a dark and stark environment if we continue to use these resources relentlessly.

Secondly, it will not be difficult or suffering for students to quit using plastic bags. There are several reusable meterials out there to choose. They are better in terms of quality and duration than plastic bags. Promoting these products is easy in school and will not likely to cause any major inconvenience. For example, Putney high school in the state of Vermont, US imposed a comprehensive ban on plastic bags since 2019 and the student council said that they totally accepted the policy.

In a nutshell, I suggest that our school should ban plastic bag in campus. It gives our children a better environment and is a relatively practical policy.

Essay 45:
There is a reason why the term 'Mother Earth' is getting more prevalent. As humans living on Earth, this planet has always been our one and only source of sustenance, a supply of resources that has always been there. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we try our best to maintain this sustainable relationship with Earth, however precarious it may be.

Currently, the main source of pollution has been plastic. The invention of this material is a great leap into the future for humanity, as it ensures efficient and cheap production of a plethora of different items. However, there are drawbacks. Plastic has been deemed one of the hardest materials to break down, which means that it poses a dire threat to this planet. One single piece of plastic can remain intact for thousands of years, harming eco systems and all species of flora and fauna.

The most prevalent use of plastic? Plastic bags. Yes reader, you have definitely used them before. These lightweight mass distributed bags are extremely convenient, and yet the consequences of using them stretch far into the future. Think of all these times that you took all the items out of the bag, and carelessly toss it into the bin without a second thought. Well, this bag goes from the bin to the trash collecting truck, from the truck to the landfill. Now, it either resides in that landfill for a very long time, secreting toxins into the soil; or it is burnt, releasing green house gas into the atmosphere; or it is dumped into the ocean, smothering countless sea creatures such as turtles. All this just because people wanted a cheap way to lug things around. 

Even if you don't care about harms to the environment, pollution caused by plastic bags also harms people directly. Earth is a system that is constantly circulating, which is why plastic often ends up in water supply, even in food sources. Research has shown that humans have been consuming a larger amount of plastic in the near present. This has the potential to cause a myriad of health defects, and is suspected to be a cause of some very deadly ailments that people currently suffer from. Therefore, now is definitely the time for action.

As an environmentally aware school community, we should most definitely abolish the use of plastic bags on campus. Even though school is simply a microcosm of society, it is crucial we begin here, in a facility responsible for the education of future generations, and inform people on the importance of preserving the environment, starting with the abolishment of plastic bags.

Essay 46:
In recent years, some supermarkets have banned plastic bags, and I believe that it is a good thing. Nowadays people rarely reuse or recycle plastic bags, since they aren't easy to reuse but are very cheap. However, each time a plastic bag is thrown away, they will mostly be discarded, sometimes in the ocean or burnt. Yet these actions are bad for our environment, in the ocean, there are tons of trash, killing wildlife and disturbing entire food chains. Burning them releases lots of CO2 which is a greenhouse gas, and will contribute to global warming, causing disaster in nature, melting the polar ice caps and causing rises in sea level. All of this is because of people throwing away plastic bags, and also because of cars, factories and even cows. If we do not use plastic bags, then a lot of this can be avoided. If you think that what you do or not do matters not, then you are wrong, as every little bit helps, and with enough people, it will make some difference. Therefore, I believe that we should ban plastic bags at our school, so that we can contribute to the fight against pollution, and help make the world we live on a better place.

Essay 47:
The summer weather is hot and humid. You often sweat and feel hot. In that weather, no matter when, the air conditioner is always switched on. People often go swimming or to the beach, where the breeze is cool. Also, you will want to stay at home aand enjoy the fan or air con.

Winter is cool and dry. Many people think that it is a good weather for running, or hiking because you won't feel to hot and sweat that much. In some places, there will be snow, and, one more activity will be added----playing in the snow. You can play with snow balls or build snowmans, and some people like lying in the snow, making a snow angel. You can go skiing as well, which is almost hiking but just going down.

I like winter best. It is because I don't like to waste electricity and switch on the air con that much. When I sometimes feel heated, I would just switch on the fan or just go on with the heat. If there was snow in HK, then of course I would want to go and play in the snow. My favourite activity in the snow is skiing and making a snowman, which I like doing with my brother. He is very good at building snowmans. Especially big ones. We would make the snowman as large as we can. My brother doesn't ski, he only snowboards. We like doing those side by side. So we can chat while we slide down the hill. Winter is very fun. When I go skiing, it always brings me back to the times when I was small, and also before my brother went to England. Luckily, he will come back soon and I am looking forward to doing those things in the snow again.

Summer is boring, only hot and humid, you can feel. You can't do much in Summer

Essay 48:
    Dear schoolmates, when you are reading this, I would like to invite you to recall the last time you used a plastic bag. When and why did you use it? Have you ever consider the consequences it may bring? If you can't remember, it's fine, but mainwhile, it alarms that using plastic bags has become our daily routine. We have to reverse this situation.
    Plastic, known as the greatest and the worst invention of the twenty-first century, has brought us much harm as convenience. For example, plastic products are hard to break down, every year hundreds and thousands of tons of plastic have flooded into the ocean and the land, causing irreversible pollution and harm to the ecosystem.We have seen distressing pictures online that seagulls are suffocated by plastic bags and sea turtles are wrapped up by plastic bags. What's worse is that some researches have found microplastic inside human body.
    In order to deal with the situation and slow down the spread of plastic, many countries have enacted restrictions on plastic, and we may notice that some supermarkets around us have stopped providing plastic bags. It may cause some inconvenience but it is not insurmountable. I would like to call on everyone that we should ban plastic bags at school in order to do something for the bright future of humanity as teenagers. By wielding our young minds we can change the situation in a small but strong way. We can find repacement for plastic bags, we can persuade others stop using plastic bags, and we can orgnize related zctivities. Join me and ban plastic bags at school would be a good start.
