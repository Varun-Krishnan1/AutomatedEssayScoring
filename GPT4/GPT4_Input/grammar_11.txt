To the radio station,
   Good afternoon, how are you today? 
   It's my pleasure to write this email to you, explaining why I should win the competition and what I will do with the whole year of free chocolate. 
   On warm days, when the temperature is just good for sports. I would like to give out my chocolate to my classmates, teachers, neighbors, and every passenger. Spread love and joy all over the world, and do as much as I can. 
   Chocolate has always been my favorite on cold days. Enjoying the lovely snow outside while having chocolate is one of my most pleasant things. It helps me to have more energy to face the cold wind and get ready for a new day of hard work. I can also make hot chocolate with free chocolate. What's more, it will be more joyful if I can share the warmth in my heart with a bar of hot chocolate given to those who work hard even it's snowing heavily outside. Let's imagine the happiness of every normal and common face.
   Furthermore, if I win the competition and get free chocolate for a year. I will donate some of the chocolate to poor people in some areas, such as the middle east. These people are suffering from wars, diseases, and hunger. Children die for not having enough food. I just can't bear to see more tragedies happen all around the world.
   Generally speaking, I really want to win the competition and share my reward with the world. I'm just a student, I can't make the world better. But I want to try my best to help the people around me. Sharing the happiness that I have in my life. Thank you for letting me have this opportunity!
                                                                                                                                          Misty Chen

Essay 203:
If a famous person came to my house then I imagine them to be Bts Jimin. He is really handsome and kind towards everyone he sees. He is Korean and right now he has brown hair with some tattoos on him. Jimin is also the shortest out of Bts but is an amazing dancer. His nicknames are ChimChim, Mochi and Diminie. Jimin is part of BTS, one of the world's biggest boy bands, with their fans named Bts. Bts started getting more attention in 2017, which is when fans started noticing Jimin. He was seen as an exceptional dancer among the members of BTS and kpop in general. People praised him for having smooth and elegant movements. Not only this but he is hilarious and knows how to keep people entertained. Jimin has phenomenal visuals and talent. His voice has captured many fans as they describe it as heavenly. The first thing I would say to Jimin is how much he has impacted my life, as Bts's main goal in their music is to make people themselves. Jimin has been my role model for years and I just want him to know that people do care about him as he has low self-esteem and thinks of himself as lowly. I would also tell him that there are millions of people who are willing to listen to his troubles as he doesn't have people whom he can always rely on to talk to. I would mainly just talk about how great he is and how he has helped so many people love themselves again.  I would show them lyrics where I have annotated them so he knows that his songs truly do have an impact on us. I would also show him my plants as he really enjoys nature.

First reason is it might make the earth become pollution, i guese someone will ask why and how,. So it basicly that example, in the ocen, have a lot of people throw the waste into the ocen and they just think basicly that it will be normal because it make you feel more convenience instead of go around to clean the trash. But opposite with that, throw the wast into the ocean it extremely harmful. Sometime the sea animal might eat that and they will die because of choking. Another reason is it might cannot recycle so the smell of it will spread out everywhere. So the earth will become pollution, and it call airpollution. When the air become too much pollution, it will make the inhabitants get disease and they might be die .But in this one,we have a solution is appeal to everyone to pick up trash.

That is all my opinion so i hope that you guys can think about it and cancle this rule.

First,plastic bags will pollute the environment,plastic bags are hard to disapper on their own so that human need to burn millions of plastic bags which people have used before every year.This will make the air beacome not clean as before.If people always breathe dirty air,their body may beacome bad.Can you imagine your famliy or your friends body become very bad?This is why some supermarkets in a number og countries have banned plastic bags in recent years.
What's more,we don't need to buy something always with a plastic bag.Now,more and more countries have ddeveped many new types of bags instead of Plastuc bags.The new types of bags won't make pollution to our mother land.We always use plastic bag to carry something,but after that we just throw it to the ban,it is such a waste for students,even for people.So why not to use a new type of bag to shopping instead of plastic bags which will destory our environment and bad for our health.
Finally,let's protect our earth and the environment together.Plastic bags should be banned at our school,isn't it?
