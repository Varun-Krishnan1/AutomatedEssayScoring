Essay 141:
It is generally believed that some supermarkets have benned plastic bags in recent years. Some students belived that the school should keep using plastic bags. However, in my opinion, plastic bags should be banned in my school. I am going to elaborate my point in the following paragraphs.
First of all, using plastic bags will pollute the envoirment seriously. Nowadays, many people are using the plastic bags, but the plastic are harmful for the ground. It can pollute crops, when people eat food, they might be get poisoned. And using the plastic bags will make people get sick, more serious cases will lead to disease.
Secondly, using plastic bags will cause the death of sea animals. Today, many sea animals die from eating plastic bags. Not only because people throw plastic bags, but also because people produce plastic bags. There is a kind of harmful gas in plastic bags, which can harm people and animal organs. If sea animals die out, it will cause indescribable harm to people and the world. Land animals are no exception too. 
In conclusion, people needs to reduce the using of plastic bags and the production of the plastic bags, and plastic bags should also be banned at school.

Essay 142:
My favorite superhero would be Spiderman, also known as Peter Parker in his series. I've always admired his character as he was a big part of my childhood. His main appearance has a suit that covers his entire body along with a mask that allows him to see through the eyepatches. It's covered in red, black and blue colors with what seems like to be spiderwebs drawn across his body, with a big black spider icon patched on it's chest. Their special abilities and skills are based off of a spider's abilities such as climbing and sticking onto walls, having able shoot webs out of his wrists and grants him superhuman strength.
Spiderman has kind intentions and polite way to handle things, that's what makes me like more about him. The idea of being based off of a spider and using it's abilities to move around and help others in need is purely kind and amazing. That's what makes me admire him the most out of any other superheros.

Essay 143:
There are a lot of superheros in books or movies, and who is my superhero? My favourite superhero is Wolverine. This essay will look at my superhero and why I like him.
Wolverine is a human adult with hair tilt up on each side. His superpower can stretch out paws from his hand, heal himself very fast, and he is also very strong. Sometimes his healing time can be faster than the time he's getting hurt. Thats why he's so strong in the movie X-man.
I like Wolverine the best is because he never gives up his team mate. He has the leader spirit and mostly he's handsome. I suppose Wolverine is difinitely the optimal superhero to exist.

Essay 144:
Plastic bags have been a staple to our lifestyle for a lengthy amount of time. Huge amounts can be purchased for very cheap, it's fairly easy to dispose, and can be used for a variety of different things. However, plastic bags are a threat to the environment. The core material, plastic, does not break down and because it's very light, plastic bags are able to get stuck in cracks and crevices of the earth. For example, when these bags float into the sea, or a body of water living things such as fish or turtles might get stuck in the plastic or even start to consume it. Chemicals released by the plastic bags get into the soil and ruin it. In the long run, using plastic bags is not worth it for the environment. The good news is, there are so many more sustainable alternatives to fight this problem! Instead of using plastic bags to bring your lunch, or carry around food, reusable totes or lunch bags are fantastic for the job. Let's say you've just done PE and you don't want dirty clothes floating around your backpack, dry bags make cleaning up super easy. All these replacements for plastic bags lasts, are harmless to the environment, and work the same way plastic bags would. We can all help the world by making small changes together. Let's stop using plastic bags!

                                                                                                          Should plastic bags be banned in school ?
                                                                                                                                     By Micah Pang 

Nowadays people can find plastic bags anywhere, but do you know what can a plastic bag do to the nature ? Plastic bags can lead to serious risks like sea pollution, overflowing landfills, broken down into toxic substances. All though plastic bag is harmful, people still use it because it is convinent and therefore number of serious problems produced by plastic bag has been increasing. 

Here are some reasons why plastic bag should be banned. Firstly, plastic bags can ruin the ecosystem. For example, there are many cases about sea turtle eating plastic bag because they thought that was jelly fish. As a result, the sea turtles died because they are not able to digest the plastic bags. Another reason is that plastic bag can overflow the landfills. Plastics are substances that are hard to decompose, it may need 1000 years to be decompose. In this 1000 years, the plastic bag will be broken down slowly and continue to pollute the environment. Therefore plastic bags should be banned in school. 

People may worry that their banning plastic bags in school may affect them. For example they may need to bring a bag when they are buying things in the school. We can use items like paper bags to replace plastic bags. Shops in school can change to sell paper bags instead of plastic bags to students. If students don't want to buy paper bags from the shops, they can bring their own bag to school. And this won't affect students and it will be covinient too. 

In conclusion, I believe that plastic bags should be banned in the school so we can save the environment and also the animals. According to the ideas above, students can use different items or ways to reduce the number of plastic bag used in the school. We should build a community that cares and therefore the school should ban plastic bags to save the world. 

Essay 146:
My favourite superhero is Wonder Woman. Flowing long black hair, serene face, bright sparkling eyes, magnificent armor and a shining sword -- when people speak of Wonder  Woman, the image of her comes to mind immediately. I still remember I first saw this character on TV. I was pleasantly surprised as the superhero characters were mostly males. Once I had my eyes on her, my eyes were completely glued to the screen as Wonder Woman's stunning looks and her astonishing combat skills captured all of my attention. Wonder Woman possesses inhuman strength, agility, and combat skills, being able to leap really high and sprint for long distances without tiring. I admire Wonder Woman because she has a direct, straight-forward, honest personality: she always says the truth and does not seem to be much exposed to the evils of the world, being innocent and pure even after experiencing a lot. She is kind and selfless, willing to sacrifice herself to save humans. This superhero also means much to me because it is a symbol of the strength of feminity. She is proof that girls can be heroes too and accomplish great things, giving me courage to stand up for myself in daily life. When I encounter troubles in daily life, I always think :  " Wonder Woman would never give up and fight till the end despite difficulties; I must not give up also!" I look up to Wonder Woman as an ideal example and I admire her for all her amazing qualities. I have much to learn from her and she is definitely my favourite superhero!

Dear Bob,

Last night, I had an incredible dream.  I was in a world made up of only food and drinks.  Everything was edible, just like an all-you-can-eat buffet!  There were gingerbread people, candy cane traffic lights, ornage juice rivers, biscuit animals and cars made of hot dogs! 

I saw my family next to me, but to my surprise, they were entirely made of marshmallows.  I began munching ont the trees, which were enormous bunches of broccoli, but instead of brocolli, honey was oozing out.  Suddenly, it was snowing ice-cream everywhere.  I saw a gigantic drumstick and rushed to get a bite, but I woke up to discover that I rolled out of bed.  It was heaven for a child who likes to eat, like me.

I wish that I could visit this world again in the future.  It is the best dream

Essay 152:
The strangest animal I have seen is a cheetah. It has yellow fur with black spots. It's small eyes and sharp teeth makes it look unfriendly.
Most cheetahs live in the plains or in zoos. The first time I have seen a cheetah was in an animal documentary. I am very scared of cheetahs since they have sharp teeth and they are very fast.In the animal documentarys, they often catch animals in the blink of an eye, and eat them. The scene is quite frighteneing for me. Therefore, I think a cheetahs is a dangerous creature.
Despite its threatening looks, a cheetah can only chirp like a bird! When I first saw cheetahs, I thought they will roar loudly like lions. I was very surprised when I heard their sound at first.
Therefore, a cheetah is definitly the strangst animal I have ever seen. I will never judge a book by its cover again!

Her appearance let people think she is very mature but a bit dangerous, like roses, beautiful but harmful. She is very famous in Hollywood as she has acted in about 30 character which are all apprciate by the film critic as well as the audiences. When she arrived, I will welcome her in front of my daimon and start chatting with her. I would probably talk questions about the movie that she have acted in. For example, how hard she was when she was doing some dangerous action in the film, has she ever met some nasty actor, what does she usually do before filmimg a movie, etc. These questions are able to let me know more about filming is not that easy, but needs a lot of effort and patience. After chating with her, I will invite her to come into my room and show all the postures, cards, magazines which all about her in order to she how much I like her.

Essay 157:
Here he comes! Swinging through the city! From an ordinary human, to a superhero that saved millions of lives, just in one night! The films about him showed how powerful he was as a sueprhero, but also his strength thoughout his childhood which was filled with loss. My favourite superhero is SpiderMan! SpiderMan, also known as Peter Parker, is a young boy that has arachnid like powers, he wears a red and blue creepy yet cool suit and has self-designed web shooters to catch and criminal in sight. He also mastered a special skill called "Spider Sense", it warns him of  upcoming danger. As stealthy as a cheetah, as sneaky as a thief, he always manages to save humanity. 

After his beloved Uncle Ben died to a burglar, grief-stricken Peter was determined to protect his city, and thoughout his missions, he learnt a indispensable lesson, "With great power come great responsibility". I adore Spiderman because it is very relatable since he goes through somethingthat basically everyone has to go through. When he has power, he forgets about family and his responsibility and he also has problems with relationships and guilt. I'm sure that's the case for most teenagers at his age. Also, another reason why I adore spiderman so much is because of his superhuman powers, clinging to walls like bats, swinging to places like monkies, and using webs to catch "prey" like spiders. 

SpiderMan is such an iconic, intelligent and heroic superhero. He is in everyone's childhood memories, and I'm sure everyone would wish to have his powers to save the world!

Essay 158:
In modern times, there are lots of different celebrities who are all famous for a variety of things.

In the unlikely event of a celebrity visiting my home, he/she would likely be famous because of the books he/she writes since I enjoy reading. Reading is like water to me, I need it to survive. My favourite author is J.K Rowling. She has hair the shade of copper which frames her face elegantly, matching with her long and elegant nose. She has stunning and bright blue eyes and thin lips. J.K Rowling is most famous for her book series Harry Potter. I am fascinated with the way she can make an entire world with words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters.

If she ever did visit me, I would make sure to prepare a lot of questions about the process of writing, for example, 'Is writing and publishing a book distressing and tiring in any way?' I would ask these questions because I would like to become a writer someday since in my opinion, spinning a world out of words seems very tempting and also interesting. It would be an exciting way to share my thoughts to people all across the world.

The thing I wouldn't hesitate to show her would be my study room. This is because books are scattered everywhere in my room. My books are my most precious possesions and I usually don't return all of them to the bookshelf since it is already brimming with books. There even is a loose nail in the corner because of the weight of all the books. I sincerely hope that J.K Rowling would approve of my messy book-filled room. I would also show her some of the short descriptions of different places I have written over the years and ask for her commentary and advice.

It would be such a huge wonder if J.K Rowling, or any celebrity, came to visit my home.

Essay 159:
  Do you have a favourite superhero? Yes, I have. My favourite superhero is spiderman. He looks very handsome when he doesn't wear his battle suit. However, when he wear on his battle suit, he shows a different feeling which makes me feel that he is a strong and protective person. 
  He has one special skill, which is the reason why this superhero is very popular, the spider silk. With his battle suit, he is able to shot spider silks from his arms to the targets, such as buildings, people, the weapons of the opponents, etc. These spider silks can help him to swing between the buildings, climb on the wall and stop the movements of his opponents. As a result, it is a very useful weapon or skill for spiderman. 
  The reason why I admire spiderman is that he is very helpful and kind. After he knew that he has the ability to shot spider silks, he use this ability to fight against the bad guys and save people in the city, but not use them to harm others. Moreover, heis a perseverance person. Even though he was at a disadvantage in the battle between the bad guys, still, he stand up a fight, but not escape. He shows a lots of good personality in the movies and this is the main reason why I admire him. 
  Spiderman is a really kind and tough person and he is my favourite superhero.
