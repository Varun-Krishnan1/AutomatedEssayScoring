As the technology developes, people do not bother to reuse, instead, more disposable items are produced such as plastic bags. However, as they are convenient, more supermarkets around the world decide to ban them because of their damage to the environment and human society. I strongly believe that our school should ban the use of plastic bags.

To begin with, plastic is extremely harmful to the soil. This poisonous material takes hundreds of years to be totally disolved in nature. In these years, tiny pieces of plastic can be mixed into the earth, and cause negative chemical reactions. As a result, the soil in particular areas will be less fertile and in bad condition for crops. For instance, human agriculture will be largely affected. This is a serious threat to all species, from tiny insects to large mammals.

In addition, human health can also be in danger because of this material. Since it cannot be disolved, disposed pieces of plastic eaten by microbes in the ocean, can be brought up from the bottom of the food chain to our stomach. After years of saving these tiny pieces in our body, our organs will be seriously damaged by the chemical material.

In conclusion, this threat is surrounding us in our daily life, the best way to avoid it hurting more peolpe, living things and our environment, is to ban it. Save our environment.

Essay 289:
For a long time, plastic bag was part of our daily life. It helps us a lot and we use it in various way. However, some research indicate that plastic bag has serious pollution, which is ture. Therefore, some supermarkets, from different courtries, generally banned plastic bags. From my perspective, I strongly believe that we should stop using plastic bags in our school. 

To begin with, plastic bag might pollute our school. Some research suggest that plastic bag is hard to dissolve. If we lose some plastic bag in soild, it needs to take a hundred years to resolve it. However, there is not a suitable way to recycle or deal with it. Unforturnately, we use huge amount of plastic bags in daily life, which means that plastic bags are easy to become pollution. 

On the other hand, we are more likely to waste plastic bags. We could see that plastic bags are easy to be destructed. It is hard to use one plastic bag for several times. In this case, we have to buy a large amount of platsic bags just for several times shopping. 

Addmittedly, plastic bag helps us in many ways. It is not only cheap for people, but also useful. However, we could use bags that are made by recycling materials. After all, I still suggest students to ban plastic bag in our school. Maybe one person's contribution is small, but together, our contribution will not be ingnored.

Essay 294:
Ban Plastic Bags!

Using plastic bags when grocery shopping or buying food is very convient as you don't have to bring your own reusable market bag. However have you ever thought about how harmful plastic bags can be to the environment? In this article, I will be sharing my opinions on why banning plastic bags in our school is important.

Plastic, in general can take up to 1000 years to decompose. It is very harmful to the environment because even after it decompose, there would still be a lot of toxic particles from it. If animals accidently ingest them, they might die or have long-term health issues. This might potentially harm the ecosystem too. 

Moreover, if plastic bags are disposed incorrectly and are thrown into the ocean, it can harm the aquatic life. Studies in the US shows that every year, about 300 billion plastic bags are ended in the ocean. Imagine how how your living environment would be like if your home is invaded by tons of plastic bags. Horrible!

Lastly, recycling plastic bags are extremely difficult. The reason for that is because plastics are made up of serveral types of polymers, and meltng them together makes it so difficult and close to impossible to recycle. 

I understand that we can sometimes be forgetful, so to make it easier for everyone, our school should consider using paper bags intead. Paper bags are much more environmental friendly and it is as convinient as using a plastic bag. 

I hope that you understand the importance of banning plastic bags in our school. One small step can change the entire world.
