Essay 82:
Through the past years, calls to ban plastic bags have arose among society, due to worldwide concerns on the topic of global warming and pollution of the earth, as an act to reduce environmental pollution, stopping environmental declination at its tracks. It is now suggested that plastic bags should be banned at school, which not only reduces waste, but also nurtures students' environmental conciousness and reduces massive usage of plastic products.

Firstly, banning plastic bags at school reduces waste, which is a main component of environmental protection. As plastic bags cannot be reused, they contribute to millions of tons of garbage in the world every year. Due to the unbiodegrable feature of plastic, they cause immense pollution to the environment, destroying lands and oceans. With the vast amount of students in school, the policy of banning plastic bag usage may lead to reduction of large amounts of plastic waste, thereby slowing down environmental pollution and the consequences of such, for example global warming or habitat loss of animals.

Secondly, environmental consciousness of students may be built up. By banning plastic bags at school, students may earn of actions of mankind to try to protect the environment. The ban exists in supermarkets in multiple countries, and the school trying such a policy may nourish students' interest in environmental protection, and information of the threats the world is facing can be introduced to students, as components of the plastic bag ban policy, giving students an insight of the centre of global attention, which may have large impact in the following years. Reduction of plastic usage may also help them develop a habit of reducing waste, and using reusable containers instead of plastic bags.

Thirdly, the usage of plastic bags in school is rather unnecessary, thus would not lead to too much discomfort amongst students. Main activities of students at school are usually learning in class or joining extra-curricular activities, both of which doesn't include using plastic. As students in school usually eat out or in the cafeteria, reusable containers or utensils are used. Fabric bags are commonly used to hold books or learning material, as examples of how plastic bags are completely uninvolved. Therefore, it is held that banning of plastic bags in school would not lead to unconvenience.

All in all, by weighing both environmental considerations and necessity of plastic bags in the school, it is concluded that plastic bags are unnecessary, and the ban would help students develop environmental interest and concerns, therefore it is suggested for plastic bags to be banned at our school.

Essay 83:
Everybody has got a superhero, and so do I...

Through electronics, people admire superheroes for saving villages, defeating villains, and being powerful but warmhearted. Heroes and normal citizens would be stereotyped in a variety of ways, creating a distant difference between one another. Yet, as a famous saying: "not every superhero wear capes", this has altered my biased perspective about heroes entirely. 

She, my life-long role model, has been with me throughout my childhood till now, every single painful situation, like a keen blade stabbing my body murderously with no mercy, and every uplifting moment. With every tear streaming down my eyes, like a river casually flowing down, and each pleasant smile that has been plastered up against my face, she has always been around, carefully advising considerable comments. Also, every single word she peacefully uttered is deeply cherished and remembered wholeheartedly in my hopeless soul.

She saved my life, my hero...

 

Essay 84:
  Chocolate. A sweet created with coco and sugar. Although it might seem like nothing more that a simple sweet that everyone loves, it can a lot of people that don't have enough income to even support themselves. Here are a few reasons why i should be the winner.
  Firstly, I will give out as much chocolate i can to anyone who might need it. A lot of people who don't have a sufficient income might not be able to feed themselves or their families. I can help them by giving the chocolate out in different types of food. You might be a bit confused but hear me out. I can turn the chocolate into different food such as spliting the chocolate into small pieces and mixing them with dough, creating chocolate crackers. I can also turn the chocolate into chocolate drinks by melting the chocolate and adding a bit of water in order to compensate the sweetness. All of the ideas above are treated with maximum hygiene. That will help a lot of people as they can have food to eat and have a lower chance of starving and getting sick.
  Secondly, it could help schools by providing the teachers with chocolate snacks instead of needing the teacher to buy it themselves. As all of you know, there are a lot of teachers out there who love to treat students with snacks if they score well in tests or do good in class. The teachers would need to buy the snacks themselves as the school isn't providing them with snacks to gift students. But if the chocolate were in my hands, i would give a plenty amount of chocolate to any teachers who would want to give their students treats if they wanted to. It can also reduce the financial stress of teachers who have lower income that want to give students a treat or two.
  That is about it for why i should be the winner. There are alot of positive things that could happen if i were the winner. And I really hope that I can be the winner as I had always wanted to help people who are in need. Thank you!

Dear Friend,

  I had a weird dream and it brought me memories, and I hope I could share it to you, 
 Last night, I was in a dream where I was in the city we used to live in. I went though the beaches and all the shops, the city was so lovely. It brings me memories about our childhood, the playgrounds that we played in, the arcade that we used to spend hours in, and how can I forget the ice cream shop. But when I was in the dream, no one could see me, I was wandering around, everything felt so real. I was amazed, I was speechless. So, for the rest of my dream I traveled across the whole city, and at one point I swear I could see our old school. It brings me nostalgia, and made it made my day. When I woke up, I was happy for the entire day. Oh also, the dream reminded me of something, we haven't talked in a while, should we meet up? I think it would be awesome!

Plastic Bags Should Be Banned

One little move that we make will impact this world big! All we have to do is to ban plastic bags, because it is harmful to the environment, wasting of money, and can be replaced. 
Plastics are harmful to the environment. plastics are not recyclable, as we can see, usually plastics are laying around on the floor, on the street, in the ocean, it's everywhere except in the garbage can. What happens next is the news about hurting the animals in the ocean or the Earth is going to be disappeared because people are not throwing the plastics in the garbage can. So instead of seeing plastics everywhere in the school and trying to figure out who it was, plastics should be banned.
Plastics are a waste of money. Even plastic bags are often used, but normally it's used because people wanted to take away food or they couldn't finish the food. Instead of telling people to stop wasting their food, the school should just ban plastic bag so that they couldn't keep the food. The money that is used to buy plastic can be added to the school supplies and to the charity. 
Plastic bags could be replaced by a lot of other things. Plastics could be shown everywhere but they can also be replaced by other things. For example, plastic spoons can be replaced by wood spoons, plastic straws can be replaced by paper straws, and plastic bags can be replaced by fabric bags. 
In conclusion, plastic bags should be banned in school. Because it is harmful and not recyclable, wasting time and money, and it could easily be replaced by other things. Nowadays, more supermarkets are starting to ban plastic bags, and more restaurants are stopping using plastic straws and to-go bags, our school should do something like that, too!

                                                                                                             Platapus the Strange Animal

One day when I went to the zoo with my family, I saw an animal that looked very strange, it had a mouth like a duck and the body was dark brown and some part it brown like the legs. It has four legs or whatever they are, they had sharp pointy things on them at the end of each leg which is it's claws to protect itself and to get food to eat. The animal's name was called the Platapus. It was a native Australian animal which means it was first found in Australia. The animal lives in water. I don't believe that the animal live in salt water but it rather lives in fresh water, like lakes and river. There used to be a lot of them in Australia but now they are named as indangered species. In the zoo I saw it in a tank as in a tank for animals not the tanks they use in the war. I think the strange thing about them is that they have a mouth like a duck but have a body that does not look like a duck. They also have the strange claws to protect and attack. I think that is the most strange thing about the Platapus. But there is still many other strange thing about them like, why is their mouth so long and why is it the colours that it is on their body.
