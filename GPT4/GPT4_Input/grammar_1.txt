Essay 1:
The other night I fell into a very deep sleep.  I know this because I didn't wake up until a lion was about to eat me alive!

Let me tell you about it ... My brother and I had decided to get on a train and go to the zoo.  It was a beautiful morning of the school holidays, and Mum and Dad had both gone to work.  Now that we are both teenagers, they let us stay home without a babysitter but we knew we were being naughty to take a train into the city.  But the day was too good to waste sitting around at home.

We had to catch a train and then a tram, but we made it by lunchtime.  After paying the entrance fee, we made our way to the lions' den because both my brother and I like the lions the most.  Usually when we have seen them they are all sleepy and not walking around, but today when we got there they were all up and about.  A crowd was gathering around their enclosure as one lion was getting quite restless and started charging towards the fence.  Cam and I pushed our way to the front just as the lion dived at the fence once more.  This time, the fence gave way and the lion was landing on top of us.  I screamed and grabbed Cam's arm as we fell to the ground under the weight of the lion.  As I looked up in horror, the lion was opening up his mouth to take us both for dinner .....

And that's when I woke up!  I have never been so relieved in all my life to wake up and find that it was still night time and I was alone in my bedroom.  It wasn't exactly a 'Sweet Dream', but we could have been a sweet main course for the runaway lion that afternoon!

Essay 8:
If I knew a famous person was going to visit my home, firstly I would get in the industrial cleaners. The most famous person that I would love to visit would be the gorgeous Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is wonderful at his craft and extremely handsome. He is tall, has medium coloured hair, sprinkled with grey and is very sophisticated! I would love to discuuss his history in the theatre, on screen and his dancing. He was a dancer before he embarked on his acting career and I would ask him what prompted the move from dancing to acting.
There wouldn't be much to show him in my tiny house, but I would offer him a long glass of wine in the garden.

Essay 9:
I think the strangest animal I have every seen is a squid.  It swims in the ocean and is closely related to the octopus.  Both have eight legs, but the squid also has two long tentacles that they use to catch their food and put big chunks straight into their mouth.  

The squid is such an unusual looking animal - it almost looks prehistoric.  It's extremely ugly, with two big eyes close to it's legs.  It has a couple of fins at the top of it's head as well, which helps propel it through the water.  I don't think they are dangerous, but I'd be pretty scared if I came across one in the water.  Squids can actually grow up to 20 metres long, but most are much smaller.

I think the best part of a squid is eating it!  I really love calamari - lightly battered, fried, and served with aioli.  Yum!  Imagine how much calamari you could get from a 20 metre long squid!

Essay 10:

Essay 12:
In the dream I was in a huge and beautiful castle, I ate ice cream and played in the garden. In my dream my sister, mom, pets, dad and aunt is in there. In the dream I also saw a pack of wolves being tamed by my sister, maybe because I know she loves dogs. I also rolled in the green grass playing with my dogs. Then I skipped around the hallway wondering what to do, so I went to eat a grand lunch with my family. When I first took a bite suddenly I woke up feeling confused i thought I was eating lunch in the morning.

Essay 14:
  My favourite season is winter. The weather in winter is amazing, sometimes there will be snow and I could make snowmen, make snow angels and have snowball fights! Summer is really fun too, it is hot and sometimes it might rain. The thing that makes winter my favourite season is because it will snow, and I could go snowboarding with my family. Once I went to Japan when it snowed. I had an awsome holiday, there was gigantic hotels with delicouse food. I slept with my sister and my aunt, my mom and dad had their own room. It was the best trip ever.

Essay 16:
One of the reasons that plastic should be banned at our school is because plastic bags have become a hazard for all living creatures, it takes hundreds of years to decompose. This is also one of the biggest polluters of the ocean. Millions of animals are killed by plastic every year because most of the plastic we use ends up in landfills or the ocean, the plastic takes a very long time to decompose because it is man made and not natrually produced in nature. There are only a few species of animals that can decopose the plastic but there is already 8 billion tons of plastic in the ocean and on land. Humans make 10 million pecies of plastic every day and if we do not stop using plastic there would be mass extinction of animals on the planet in a short amount of time. Another reason for our school to ban plasic is because most plastics are non renewable and contribute to climate change. Climate change is the change in tempratures and weather around the world. climate change destroys the places the animals live and therefore the animals will have nowhere left to live. Reducing the use of plastic or just not using it at all, will greatly benefit the world be lowering the CO2 emissions and plastic would not end up in the ocean and the land we live on.

Essay 17:
I heard somebody knocking on the door softly. Without hesitation, I immediately opened the door and a woman stood in front of me. She was gorgeous, with black shades on and her blonde hair was tied as a bun. She also applied red lipstick very carefully as none of them was out of the border of her lip. The woman, facing in front of me was wearing a black dress, with cotton-like materials stuck onto her dress. She slipped on a pair of platform shoes which made her whole outfit spectacular.  Due to her dressing up beautifully, I assert that she would be a famous person. After all that prediction I made, I greeted her,' Salutations. You're looking fantastic today, but what brings you here?'. 'I'm just curious of how the interior of your house will look like as the outside of that is magnificent!', she replied. At first sight, I predicted that she would be a cold person but turned out that I was wrong the whole time. I let her into my house and served her a cup of tea. I let her walk wherever she wanted to and I introduced them all. Soon, she marched up the stairs first where my room was, and pleaded to chat. The mysterious woman sat on my cozy seat and started to have a glance at my room. A while later she exclaimed how lovely my room was and chatted about fashion design. Soon enough, she reminded me of a celebrity who was into fashion design and had been in several films. I questioned her if she was the one and got a reply as so,' Looks like you've struck gold today! It was a pleasure meeting you.' I was fluttered and she really was the one. She marched back to the door and her walking was the same as in the movies. 

Essay 18:
My favorite superhero is my dad. My dad looks ordinary from the outside -- short hair, a beard, and wearing a pair of glasses that has a thick black border. Mostly my dad will wear casually with a t-shirt and casual pants. However, not judging from the outside of his, he is in love in lending a hand to people, which I thought of as a special skill. A lot of people like helping others, but this is not the case in regards to my dad. One time, my dad and I went for a stroll on the beach, which is our favorite thing to do during weekends. While we were walking, a group of kids were hanging out on the shore when one of them got stung by a jellyfish and got grabbed away towards the sea. My dad immediately ran towards the child without hesitation with clothes on and pulled him back onto the shore. The child was badly hurt and my dad asked one of the staff for help. From my dad, I know that superheroes don't always wear a cape. Although my dad is ordinary, he has a passion in helping others, whom I admire. I learned that helping others in the community can not only make them feel grateful, but can also make me feel delighted as I just made a person's day. My favorite superhero, my dad.

Essay 19:
Dear Jeremy,


I once had a dream about me being Cristiano Ronaldo running across the field. 


I was speeding towards the ball when the enemy let out an annoying leg and rolled it away from my sight. I was a bit startled and couldn't react for a split second. When I started to run again towards the football, I realized Bruno Fernandes was closer and already got the ball before I did. My hair on my hands stood up and I was starting to wonder if we would lose this match when I heard the ball hurtle towards the goal. I  but was immediatly caught by the goalkeeper standing in front of it. He rolled the football to one of my enemies but this time I was the one who gave the annoying leg and got it. Then I saw that I was very close to the ball and shot the ball. WHOOSH! The ball flew past the keeper and into the net. The crowd cheered and my teammates took me high in the air and started tossing me around. But then they didn't catch me in time and the secend I knew... THUMP! I landed headed first on the ground and suddenly I opened my eyes and discovered myself lying on my cozy bed in my nice house. I was glad I didn't really fell on the ground head first but also a bit sad as I always wanted to be a famous footballer like Cristiano Ronaldo, and that is my dream. Can you tell me a dream of yours?


Best Regards,

Timothy
