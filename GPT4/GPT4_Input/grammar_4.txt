Essay 61:
  Today is the best day in my life. My idol, Alan Walker came in my house for something I don't know. 
  When I heard the bell rang, I vanished to the door. I looked out from the seeker and guess who did I saw? Alan Wlaker, my favorite person in the entire musical space. I was so surprized. I thought: Why would Alan Walker came into my house? When I was expecting all nonsenses  about him, he said :" I'm here for your dad's permission." He said. "Your dad says today is your birthday so I'm here to celebrate with you." I was so happy that I can't even repeat every word he said before. He sang the birthday song to me and blew the candle after I wished. My wish is: I can celebrate my every birthday with my idols in the future.
  Alan Walker leaved, I was still very happy.
  My dad came back with my presents. I gave him a big hug. "Thank you, I love you!" I called out. "I love you too, my sweetheart." He answered.
  Oh! How a wonderful bithday with full of pleasure and piles of presents.

Once again, staring blankly at the TV screen, I sighed hesitantly while looking at the weather forecast. "Heavy rain with thunderstorms..." uttered the news reporter with a slight smile plastered on her pale face. As I looked around, time seemed to freeze, nothing moving at all, with the television noise echoing murderously inside my brain. Knock...knock...knock... The front door creaked as I reluctantly stood up, peeking through the door hole. Blurry movements were seen outside as I curiously open my eyes wider, seeing a figure of a towering woman waving at me.

Since nervousness was cunningly obstructing my thoughts, I steadily unlocked the door. To my surprise, the international superstar singer was standing in front of me with her glossy black bucket hat on combined with sunglasses, covering her eyes. "H-h-h-hi," I stuttered anxiously as I looked down to the floor. "Hello! Nice to meet you, I have heard all sorts of stories about you. You are a journalist right..?" she smiled sweetly while staring at me. As a response, I just stood there while obediently nodding to her question. I felt like being violently sucked inside a small, dimmed room with no escape while still showered in confusion yet exhilaration. "May you show me around your house?" the woman asked politely with her eyes freely wandering around my house. "I would love to!" I exclaimed excitedly as I led her into my office.

"Beep...beep...beep..." the alarm clock rang deafeningly as I jumped right up from the bed in horror while scanning continuously around the room. No sign of any human being... So was it all just in my imagination?

Essay 63:
In recent years, some supermarkets across the world have banned plastic bags, and I belive our school community should follow in their footsteps. Countless research over the years has proven that pollution is one the main driving factors of climate change and plastic is one of the main contributors. Sure, plastic bags are quick and convient to use, but its impact on their enviorment is deadly; plastic takes decades, if not centuries to naturally dispose of. When we are still continuing to use plastic bags even though we are aware of the harm it does to our enviorment, we are showing that we do not care for our planet. Climate change may seem like to big of a problem for us students to tackle, but to help combat climate change, we must all do our part, no matter how small and insignificant it may seem. Banning the usage of plastic bags in our school may seem like a small step, but it is vital to slow the effects of climate change. To those wondering what we would use instead of plastic bags, do not worry, I have a solution in mind. Instead of using single-use platic bags, we could use totebags. Tote bags are not only stylish, and cheap, it is most importantly good for the enviorment since it can be reused. While banning platic bags may seem like an unnessecary change to some, climate change is too big of an issue for us to not take action immediately.

Last Saturday, I opened the door after I heard the knocking sound. I was extremely surprised when I saw the person standing in front of the door.

This person wore a formal dark-blue suit, he was a little bit fat, but the two big eyes and his smile made him looked friendly. It was Lang Lang, a famous pianist that I really love. He was popular, not only for his fantastic playing skills, but also for his characteristic. He established and participated in many charities for people around the world that are interested in playing the piano.

I smiled to Lang Lang and guided him to my living room. When he saw the big piano standing on the floor, he walked to it and touched the keybord gently. A piece of beautiful music flew to the sky. "Your piano is really nice.", Lang Lang said. I sat down and played a famous classical music to him. He praised and taught me how to play better. I also showed him some of my favourite music and asked him to give some comment. "There are a lot of people that play Mozart's music, but how to identify which is better?", I asked Lang Lang a question, and he was like a teacher that explained to me patiently. 

Lang Lang was a guider. He impressed me a lot and I felt enjoyable to stay with a person that also love music.

I opened the door and I was shocked to see that it wasn't any ordinary delivery man, but it was BTS! I screamed to loud even my dog sprinted down the stairs to see what was going on. "OMG! Is it really BTS?!" I screamed to the top of my lungs. "Hello we are BTS! Kim namjoon, Kim Soekjin, Minyoogi, Jung hoseok, Park jimin, Kim taehyung, Jeon Jungkook and BTS!" they greated in korean which I understood because of how much korean dramas I watched. "MOM!! BTS is here!" my mom jumped down the stairs and rushed to greet BTS with a welcoming smile. "Can I take a photo with you guys? Is it fine? Feel free to take any food from our home! This home is yours!" while my mom was babbling the words out of her mouth she was stuttering since she was also a huge fan of BTS and her Bias Wrecker was Jungkook. I quickly ran to grab seven slippers for the seven members to come into our home. All of the members had wonderful and pleasant smilings ln their faces with polite manners. I was too shocked and nervous to speak to them since I would not know they would come to my home. Each of them walked into my home and I led them to the bathroom to clean their hands. After that, My mother cooked Kimbab and rice cakes for the seven members to eat. "Wow! this is delicious!" replied Namjoon. All the other members nodded their heads and agreed since it was actually really good. "So, Why did you come to our house? What has led you guys to come to our house? Its a pleasure to have you guys come you know?" said my mother. My mother's was probably feeling exited, just like me my heart was beating really quickly because I thought I would never be able to see the BTS members in real life.

I shouted across the table. "Obviously! Sure!" As they entered my room they were gasping and in shock but in a happy way. "I bought many albums and merches from you guys!

The superhero I'm telling you today is Captain America. 

He is the best superhero I have ever seen or heard of. Captain America only excist in movies and books. I really admire Captain America because he is very smart perso and he is on the good side. I also admire him because he saved a lot of people in the movie and books. The special skills that captain America have is that he can ran super fast and his shield is a weapon and an armour to defence and attac. He is a superhero because in this movie Marvel, there was a good and helpful team member of fighters. He has this really cool armour. his armour's colour is blue and red. his helmet is an oval shape. His shield is the best thing out of the armour. In the middle of the shield is a red star and around it is red and blue stripes. And when he threw his shield away, the shield would come back to him. He superpower is mainly his shield. When he misses the enemy he can always try hiting the enemy again until he gets the enemy. I believe he was the captain of his team. In his team, everyone was a superhero and had good superpower, but I think Captain America is the best superhero in the superhero history. And when trouble comes, he is always there to help.

If you have never heard of him, you can go on the internet and search him up. 

































































































































































 

Essay 72:
Hello everyone,I'm writing to persuade you to stop using plastic bags.
As we all know,plastic bags are really harmful to the environment.They are also called"white pollution".In recent years,some supermarkets have banned plastic bags.In my opinion,we should also stop using them.Plastic bags have been banned in China for over 5 years,which makes the air much better than before.Before this ban came out,I can receive more than 5 plastic bags a day!Some people think giving customers plastic bags for free shows their good service.Luckily,the president made a ban and stop this strange think.
Plastic bags are made from factories and made by plastic.Plastic is a kind of chemistric product,which requires a lot of energy.We are actually short for energy now,so stop using plastic bags will be a good choice to save energy.Instead of using plastic bags,we can use backpacks or cloth bags which can be used fore more than one time.
Should plastic bags be baned in our school?My opinion is,YES.If you agree with me,please stop using them.Saving our planet requires all of your effort.Thank you!

People can be famous in different ways, if they are a important politician, a wealthy merchant, great scientist or an Idol. I'm going to focus on idol in this article, idol are generally famous due to better appearance compare to others, and how often they are on the screen, how often they appear in the public's view and how active, what kind of person they are. The idol I imagine comes to my home is Hua Chen Yu.

Hua Chen Yu is a Chinese and he is a male idol, specially focus on singing and a small part of acting. He is about 176 cm high and is having a good appearance in my aesthetic standard. He was famous because he has a great talen in music and was a teenager musician. He became popular when he was very young by both of his appearance and talent. He created and published lots of popular music to different age of people, and became more famous by participating in variety shows.

If I have an opportunity to make friend with him in my life, I will be very thanful in the first place. I will first tell him how admirable his is and how I adore him, I will talk about his music with him, and see what his inspiration came from. I will communicate with hime just like a friend, for not giving too. much pressure between us. We will be talking about our everydar life, and to learn about each other and see what kind of person we really are, we will be talking about things which we both interested on and what we think shouldn't be done.

I will bring him to my room, to show hime every ticket that I had for going to his concert and shows.

I will show him every sovenirs that I bought because of him, and every one of his autograph that I gathered. I will show him what I liked, what honor I got in my life, share my past experience with him, so it is not only me that know about him, just to be fair, to let him know me as well if he want to.

When he comes in my house, we are friends instead of an actor and audience. We will be showing each other the real of ourselves. We don't have to act anymore and be cautious about everything we have said and done. We will communicate with each other about thing we like and don't and show each other what we have and why I liked hime.


 

Essay 75:
Hello, today I'm going to talk about what if a famous person or celebrity comes to my home. So if some celebrity like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is a really talented soccer player comes to my house, I would propably freak out, because the odds of this happening is extremely slim. Cristiano Ronaldo is really tall (taller than my tallest family member which is my dad), he is more than 35 years old now but he still looks very young to be honest. If he ever comes to my home (which he probably never will), I would instantly ask for an autograph and his signature, like any other fan if they ever encountered him, after that though, I would ask him about his life as a extremely famous celebrity. After all the questions are done, I would show him around the whole house, it won't take even half a hour as my house is miniscule compared to his luxury mansion. Everything done, right? No, what I'm doing next might not be the best decision, but I would gift him something super valueble, like a computer or jewellery, after that's done, I would wave goodbye to him and he swiftly leaves. That's all, thank you for reading.

He is currently the richest man in the world and is a generous philantrophist. Tesla is a company that creates electric vehicles that won't be as harmful to the planet and Spacex is a company that engineers spacecrafts. Elon Musk is a hardworking person that I look up to.

If I were to see Elon Musk I would ask him what the key to sucess is. I would like to ask him this question because he inspires me to become a successful person that can impact the world in a positive way.

Essay 79:
Nowadays, the plastic bags become more and more useful in people's life. Use the plastic bag to carry the things you just bought from the supermarket is very convenient. But if too many people use plastic bags to carry the things, there will be a lot of waste plastic bags. So I think we should ban the plastic bags in our school.
The first reason is that waste plastic bags is harm to the environment. Because the plastic cannot be recycled, and it is a non degradable waste type. So if we produce and use the plastic bags, they amount of the waste plastic bags cannot be reduced, and if we just dig a hole and put the waste bags in, it will be a very seriou pollution. We cannot recycle the waste plastic bags, so we can olny reuse and reduce the plastic bags. Ban the plastic bags can reduce the amount of the waste bags, and it also can let the students to reuse the bags which they used before. So I think that ban the plastic bags will be a great policy.
Also, buy a new plastic bag for each time is going to waste a lot of money. For example, buy one plastic bag need 5 cents, that isn't too much. But if you buy a plastic bag every day, you will use 150 cents in one month. For a year, you will use 1825 cents. But if you buy a reusable woven bag, you can use it for a long period. So you can save a lot of money. So I think ban the plastic bags can help the students to build a habit what is saving money. That is good for the students working career.
To conclude, I think that to ban the plastic bags will have a lot of advantage.

Essay 80:
  Plastic bags, mostly used in supermarkets have been banned from supermarkets in a number of countries. The most common reason is to be more eco-friendly and to produce less waste, and also to protect the animals such as turtles as they might confuse plastic bags for food. Yet our school hasn't acknowledge the negative impact plastic bags could have in school.
  FIrstly, allowing plastic bags could destroy lives of some sea anmals. As you all might know, animals such as turtles and dolphines eat jelly fish, which is mostly transparent. The dolphines and turtles might confuse plastic bags that have been thrown into the sea by humans as jelly fishes. That could make them sufficate or seriously hurt them, which may lead dolphines to extinct. Plastic bags could also destroy homes of sea animals that live on seabeds  by covering the seabed with live-threatening plastic bags.
  Secondly, younger students might play with plastic bags and accindentally hurt other students with plastic bags. Almost every children have no intention of harming other people, matter of fact they even love to interact with their peers and play with each others. But they might not know what they should play with and what they shouldn't play with. Younger students might think that playing with plastic bags and making it a hat funny, some students might also think that putting a plastic bag on their head funny. But they have no idea that it could possibly sufficate other classmates without the intention of doing so, which could cause serious injuries and even death.
  Thirdly, there will be alot of waste produced by both students and teachers. Although plastic bags are very convenient, it carries a lot of disadvantages, such as it is a one time use item. Most people think that it would be way faster to through plastic bags in normal rubbish bins rather than recycling bins, which could effect the environment by producing a lot of waste and polluting the air as the bags are being burnt when sent to the wasteland. It could also harm the enviroment if some people litter
  In conclution, I think that school should ban plastic bags and heavily recommend everyone in the school to use bags that can be used more than once. Not only can that save the enviroment and animals, it could also save the energy spent on recycling the plastic bags.
