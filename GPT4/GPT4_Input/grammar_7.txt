Essay 122:
  Hello everyone, a lot of you may already knew that in recent years some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags and you may wonder why, so today I'm going to talk about the harm that the plastic bags have done to our environment and why we shouldn't use it in our school.
  As we all know, after shopping in the supermarket, the shop assistant may ask you whether you need a plastic bag. I know it's very convenient at the moment, but when you arrive home you may just throw them away. At last the plastic bags will be bury under the soil. Since it's hard for the plastic bags to decompose itself, it will stay under the soil forever and cause damage to the ecosystem.
  When you are walking by the sea, except for the beautiful sea view, you may also see there are many floating plastic bags. This is what we called "White pollution". Animals living in the sea were finding out eating the plastic bags accidentally, this always lead them to death without other's help. Plastic bags have caused serious pollution to the environment of the sea.
  What will plastic bags do to our school? I believe that you have already seen the plastic bags which were hanging on the tree branches and made it harder for the cleaners to make our campus neat and tidy. But what can we do since the plastic bags are bad for our campus and our world? Here are my suggestions.
  First, find yourself your own shopping bag which is not made by plastic so when you're about to shopping, you can bring it with you. Second, if you saw someone throwing the plastic bag on the ground or into the sea, it won't be nosy if you stand out and stop him or her. This will also do good to the environment. Third, what about spreading the word about the dangers of plastic bags? This may let more people know that the plastic bags are bad for the environment.
  Thank you for reading so far and let's make the world a better place by banning the use of the plastic bags.

 The doorbell rang, echoing in the corridoor. However, no one should be coming at this point of the day. Who is outside the door?

She is a famous detective fiction author, and wrote many splendid detective novels which I cherish and are kept in my bookshelves.
  "Miss, it's a great pleasure to meet you! I'm a big fan of your books! Why have you visited here?"

Plastics have been with us for decades and plays a huge part of our daily life. Believe me when I say you can find plastic just right next to you, for example some parts of your watter bottle is made of plastics or the pen that sits on your table is made of plastic as well. One of the most used plastic of all time is plastic bags.  As time goes by plastic bags has been more acceptable in our daily use and has a positive outlook for our own needs. Yet, not so many people look at the waste of plastic bags and how it has been ruining our enviroment this whole time! Scientist has prooven that plastic can take up to 450 years to be fully removen in our modern world, so in this essay I would like to talk more about this problem that needs to be fully vanished.
As the generation moves on most people became more self absorbed and only caring about their first priorities rather than the people around us. Plastic bags is the cause of living things such as sea creatures decreasing little by little. This is cause by the fact that we are still using plastic bags up till this day and causing more rubbish in to our ocean and our enviroment. Remember that, we all live on earth and absolutely no one wants to live in a nasty enviroment full of trash and plastic bags flowing around everywhere. Killing animals will definitely ruin our food system living us with barely edible food. I am here to tell you all as a member of this school that every of you can make a huge diffirence in the future right now. Starting from today plastic bags should be banned. Rather than using thin, unsustanable bags, why not use cloth bags or reusable bags? This would create a difference for our mother earth and we can always reused it whenever we like! Without your health our earth would not heal and become a happy place for everyone.

Essay 131:
These years,many supermarkets begin to ban the plastic bags.As for our school,I think we also need to stop using it .Here are my reasons.
First,plastic bags is really harmful to the environment.As we all know,plastic is a kind of material getting from fossil.It takes a lot of time for plastic to get into the earth.Even if it get into the earth,it is also bad to the ground,it can make the ground become worth.Further more,there wasn't any nice way to get the plastic in to another kind of materials.If we throw it into the sea,many sea creatures will eat it by mistake,this may kill a small but valuable life.If the number of the sea creatures decrease, it will also have a big influence on human ourself.
Second,the number of the used plastic bag each year is a lot.Each of us is just one of the seven billion people living onthe earth.Although maybe we just use one plastic bag,the total number is still really shocked.Before we use it we should think about it bad influence.
Third,it is really inconvenient for the cleaner in our school.Most of the plastic bag can ohly be used once,so the whole number of it in our school per day must be huge,this can be a large work for the cleaners.They help us to keep our school clean so why don't we do something to help them feel less stressful?
Further more,some scientists mentioned that some of the plastic are poisonous.This means they are bad for our health,so why do we use them?
All in all,protect the environment is just protect ourselves.Maybe banned using plastc bags will be kind of inconvinient but please understand a thing,that is,the every environmentlly friendly actions you do is just saving the planet for our children.So maybe you can buy a new bag which is made of cotton or cloth instead of a plastic one.Please obey the new school rule.

Essay 134:
Good afternoon students, teachers and parents. I am writing this article to you today, to educate you on the harmful effects of plastic bags to the environment in hopes of reducing our usage of plasic bags as a community. The first victims of our excess production of plastic bags are the turtles. Contrary to common beliefs, plastic bags cannot be degraded, hence they often get thrown into landfills near the ocean. This often results in plastic bags (along with other trash), getting scattered into the ocean, leading to turtles unfortunately mistaking it as food. As a consequence, they fall ill/ die as their body is unable to digest it. According to studies, around 1000 turtles fall victim to our excess production and misplacement of these plastic bags.

Furthermore, the production of plastic bags is causing a mass effect on our environment. This is because a large amount toxic pollutants is emitted into the environment in order to produce plastic bags, further accelerating global warming. This effects have already been shown by statistics as scientist speculate that global warming is happening faster than expected due to the climb of demand of plastic. 

In conclusion, I urge you to reduce your usage of plastic bags in school to a minimum and alternatively use reuseable bags. We, as a community, should unite and endevour to save, protect and preserve our marine life. Although some may argue, that our small community would affect little change, given that plastic bags are still the most produced and consumed material in the world, however I believe that if we are able to ban plastic bags here, we would set an amazing precendent for others to follow. Let us be the generation to create change

Essay 136:
In these recent years, shops snd supermarkets in the country have stopped using plastic bags, I wrote this article to persuade the students in our school to stop using plastic bags as well, down here are some reasons why plastic bags should be stopped using.

Firstly, plastic bags are single used, people only use it once and throw it away. Thrown away plastic bags can pollute the environment includind our land and water. Next, because they're so lightweight, plastic bags can travel long distances by wind and water. After that sea creatures think the plastics bags are food and then eat them, eventually they will choke and starve to death. As these problems occur, people have volunteered to pick up trash in many polluted places including beaches, forests, and in cities also.

Another reason is that plastic bags take a long time to decompose, they make take up thousands of years to decompose completely. Using plastic bags are dangerous for our health too, this is because animals and sea creatures that ate the trash( including plasic bags) end up being our food.

We don't have to stop using them completely, just don't use it one time. Many people reuse plastic bags and some also recycles them into environment-friendly products. I hope the school can stop using plastic bags so we can have a cleaner planet.

Dear radio station, 
I heard you are holding a competition recently, I loved to be engaged in this opputinity of making our society a better place. I should be the winner because i have some great ideas of benefiting the most from the "one-year supply free chocolate" price. If i successfully get the chance, i will cooperate with the government and persuade the politicians to give us a great place to give the free chocolates out. A great location in my opinion is a place with plenty outside area which i can put tables and chairs, plus a great view that every one can enjoy the scenery. In addition, i won't just give out chocolate bars for free, there will be plenty chocolate products, different shapes, and different food which are made of chocolate. For example, chocolate bar, chocolate cakes, chocolate milk, chocolate ice-cream, and many more. When the selling part adds in, based on my fabulous marking skills, i will make the chocolate shop a hot area which people come and enjoy chocolate while chating with friends and taking gorgeous pictures. The ones that came would be addited to this free and relaxing place, and will gather more and more friends to come and have free chocolates. My ultimate goal is to let the citizens in my region know that there is a great place where you can get delicous chocolate for free and entertain those who comes. There's an old saying, "one passes ten, ten passes hundred." I believe that in a short period of time, lots of people will be attracted and be willing to spend their time at my shop. 
Hope to hear from you soon, and it will be a pleasure to operate this chocolate shop for you. 
Kind regards, 
Adrian Huang

Plastic bags have become one of the most usual thing we used in the supermarket. It's true that it makes our life more conveient, but we can't ignore the damages it brings to our environemnt. We need take our  responsibility to protect the earth. As being a student, we can start to protect our environment by not using plastic bags in our school. 

We have seen a lot of news and articles about how animals died because of accidently ingest those plastic bags. Plastic bags are really diffcult to decompose. It takes around 300 years to let them decompose completely. So as the numbers of plastic bags being used goes up, there will be more and more of them appear at the site of the sea. It creates a huge ocean pollution that kills thousand of animals because of lack of oxygen in the ocean. Imagine you can't breathe suddenly and you can't do anything for it. It feels terrible, right? That's what the animals under the sea feel when there is a ocean pollution. So for the future of our ocean, for our society, for our planet, please stop using plastic bags! 

Moreover, producing plastic bags require lots of time and people and it is a waste of natural resoures. It seems better to use the natural resources which is scaricty for today society for electricity and heating rather than use it to produce a product that need such a long time to decompose. 21st century is being called as our generation, so it's our responsibility to protect the environment for the next generation.
