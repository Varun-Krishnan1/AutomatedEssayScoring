Essay 21:
The strangest animal I have ever seen.
It has the shape of a worm, but it's tilted aside, looking like it's standing. It has the color of white along with some stripes on its back. Wherever I go to zoos, there is always a pool of mud in which muddy animals live, for example frogs. However, there are always a couple of holes in the mud which I found fascinating. When I had a closer look at it, a white shaped creature just appeared. It immediately stick out of the mud and the following 'worms' also sticked out of the mud. It's strange for me as not only does it look like a worm, but it also stands up as if it has legs. Whenever people are near them, they become scared and right away, they go back into the hole again. They stick in and out occasionally and I still don't know why they have this kind of habit. I wonder, how do they eat and how can they stay in the hole for the rest of their lives?

Essay 24:
Do you guys realise the damage that is being done by simply the use of plastic bags? Don't get me wrong, it definetly makes life a lot easier, but recent study has shown that the amount of plastic use has increased by a drastic rate and is and the ocean is becoming more of a place to dump plastic rather than an actual habitat for sea animals to live in. If fact, you don't need a study to show you this, just look at the internet, or possibly even your own beach, because this problem is a global issue, meaning that everyone will be affected. Some people may be more vulnerable than others but it will affect everyone no matter what. The best solution to this problem is to begin now, the sooner we act, the easier it will be to fix this issue before it becomes a bigger problem, and one of the best ways to do it is by beginning to educate young children to be more environmentally friendly. Passing it on to future generations is important because this problem won't be fixed in a lifetime, and I doubt that it will be fixed in many other generations to come, but beginning now to teach our children how to live a more sustainable life for the world by eliminate plastic use in schools to ensure that the progress has begun, because it's one thing to cause a catastrophic problem... But it's another thing to make it irreversible.

Essay 30:
The use of plastic bags is destroying the planet. For many decades people have used plastic bags all around the world and it has become a daily essential. Its main purpose is to carry your groceries when you go shopping, but most people don't know the terrors of using a plastic bag. There are 3 main reasons why plastic bags should be banned at our school. The first is that it takes many years for any plastic to decompose. secondly, when producing plastic emits a lot of carbon dioxide. Thirdly, it's causing harm to wildlife and putting species in threat.

Plastic bags take many years to decompose which is the major cause of environmental damage. Plastic bags release toxic substances that'll affect the soil when they perish under the sunlight. This could lead to many plants and trees dying and not being able to grow because of the substance that is ruining the soil. Since plastic bags take a long time to decompose, humans found the best way to get rid of plastic was to burn it. At first, this seems like an excellent idea but burning the plastic will lead to the toxic substance being released into the air and cause air pollution. 

When producing plastic bags it emits a small amount of carbon dioxide but since human consumption involves mostly plastic, million tons of plastic are being produced every year, which results in a small amount of carbon dioxide emitting a large amount. As a result of this large amount of carbon dioxide, the earth's temperature is getting warmer, which leads to ice caps in the arctic melting and large floods can be seen all around the world. Millions of people were displaced out of their homes due to the floods and some don't have a place to stay anymore.

Plastic bags are also causing harm to the wildlife and putting animals endangered. Another solution that humans had found to dispose of their plastics is to dump them into the ocean or forests. Since much plastic waste was dumped into the ocean and the wildlife, many animals would either think it's food or gets trapped by the garbage and suffocate. Since plastic takes many years to decompose eating it won't decompose in your body which led to millions of animals dying and putting them endangered.

Therefore we should ban using plastic bags at our schools to prevent endangering the planet and the wildlife from our demand for human consumption. We should all start reducing are use for plastics in general to help save the planet.

 

Essay 31:
Dear school

Pollution and global warming are some of the most really serious issues in the world right now, what causes it, is plastics. But that's is not the main reason pollution happens, unresponsible people who threw that plastic product out the nature, they threw it into the ocean, the streets, and basically everywhere they go. You might think pollution and global warming are nothing, and that will happen years later, but if we keep on doing this, especially the adults, then their children and kids will look up to them, repeat what their parents did and that will speed up the process causing those issues to happen sooner. I love my school, our school, I always wanted the best for us, wanted us to be the best. So I think, we should really ban plastic bags, I don't think this is a big deal, because we can replace them with something else, like a canvas bag for example, but don't worry, plastic products surrounding our classroom shouldn't be a ban, those are plastics that we can reuse and won't release them out to the environment. But plastic products in our cafeteria should be a ban, because those are items we won't reuse, like a plastic water bottle, have you ever wondered how long it takes for a plastic water bottle to fully decompose? 450 years, for a 500ml plastic water bottle, that's insane, don't you think? A few supermarkets in some countries have banned plastic bags, even some schools have also done it, so why can't we achieve that goal too? I really wish you take my message seriously, this is just my opinion, I really want the best for our school so that's why I wrote and sent you guys this message because usually, I won't be writing letters to the school community if a problem is not that serious. Thank you for taking time out and reading my words.

Essay 35:
 Plastic bags are very important in our daily lives. A lot of people all over the world have been relying heavily on plastic bags, they would rather buy a shopping bag instead of bringing their own. Owners of supermarkets from different parts of the world have banned plastic bags in their own supermarket as they know the terrible aftermath of using plastic bags. Seeing supermarkets banning plastic bags, I suggest perhaps we could follow their lead and ban the use of plastic bags in our school. 
  Firstly, plastic bags take up a lot of time to decompose. Most people would try to burn plastic bags, but it is very hard to completely break it down. It is one of the hardest things to burn down, according to experts. We as students often use plastic bags, we probably dispose around 3 plastic bags once a week, those plastic bags will still be around in 2070! 
  Secondly, plastic bags are extremely dangerous to marine animals. Addressing the amount of plastic bags we use in our daily lives, there were at least 10 plastic bags being littered around, and you might never know where they might end up. It might end up in the ocean or even in your backyard! The problem is that most plastic bags end up in the ocean. As plastic bags are very light, they might end up in the ocean. There are multiple news of sea turtle eating up plastic bags because they think the plastic bags are jellyfish. Besides this, there are a lot of news about fishes and seabirds getting caught up in plastic. This have caused a lot of animals to die, and seriously disturbing marine life. 
  The extreme usage of plastic bags is a very important problem in the world. Even though they are more cons than pros, people are still not addressing this problem. In order to reduce the amount of plastic bags, I highly recommend the ban of plastic bags in our school. This could help the pollution by a large margin. 

Essay 36:
Bags are convenient  in our daily lives, but some types can cause a lot of harm that we do not mean to. Plastic bags are the most common type of bags made globally, though they do come in cheap prices, they  also cause extereme problems at the same time. In order to produce plastic, an enormous amount of energy and resources is needed; this causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. Although plastic could be recycled, recycling plastic has not been efficient- only about nine percent of plastic ever produces haas been recycles. Marine animals are also victims of plastic, it is harming them and ecosystems of many marine biomes and it's hazardous to human health. Our plastic consumption is directly affecting marine life in the ocean including fish, which is a main source of food for huamns as well.
Additionally, most plastics are single- use. This inclues items like plastic bags, packagings. water bottles and straws. Plastic can take hundreds or even thousands of years to degrade and most don't biodegrade completely. Instead, they gradually break down into tiny pieces of plastic which are significantly harder to remove from the environment than the larger bottles. With all this been said, I highly encourage everyone to thoroughly consider your decisions while choosing shopping bags and to save our environment by canceling out plastic bags from our school campas!
