  My favourite superhero is superman.When he has a job to save people, he will wear his uniform acording to a special blue suit that was so handsome.He is very strong and tall. Superman may have strong muscles that can help him fight aganist his enemies.
  To my favourite superhero's skills,it has a lot to say.Frist,superman has a huge power that bigger than any normal people!What's more,he also got a speacial body that cannot get hurt easily.Behind this "skill"he did plenty of exercise to keep it. Third, in some times,superman could fly in the sky.It makes his attraction more better.
  Superman's skills make him different to others, i'd like to say he was born for help everyone. The reasons that i admire the superman ,not only his perfect skills and his differences.The more about my admire to him that was i can learn a lot from him.He use his skills to help people and attack enemies even he may died.All his kindness and power that what i loved.
