My favorite superhero would be Spiderman, also known as Peter Parker in his series. I've always admired his character as he was a big part of my childhood. His main appearance has a suit that covers his entire body along with a mask that allows him to see through the eyepatches. It's covered in red, black and blue colors with what seems like to be spiderwebs drawn across his body, with a big black spider icon patched on it's chest. Their special abilities and skills are based off of a spider's abilities such as climbing and sticking onto walls, having able shoot webs out of his wrists and grants him superhuman strength.
Spiderman has kind intentions and polite way to handle things, that's what makes me like more about him. The idea of being based off of a spider and using it's abilities to move around and help others in need is purely kind and amazing. That's what makes me admire him the most out of any other superheros.
