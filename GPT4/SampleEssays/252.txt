I have a friend his name is Thomas. He has blond hair, blue eyes, white skin and slightly freckled face. Everyday we meet at school, i sometimes call him Thomas The Tanking Train Engine or TTTTE as I like to call him. Me and him play alot of pranks during free time or we chat about memes or useless information. The most we talk about is games but it sometimes can get boring. Whenever I am bored or lonely I go talk to Thomas or play tag with him and try to scare him. Thomas is a good friend and makes really funny jokes that cracks me up and makes everyone laugh sometimes he even does crazy dares like jump fifteen feet of some stairs or dance behind somebody's back. The best thing of him being a friend is that he usually doesn't get mad and is usually in a happy mood and that is why he is one of my Best Friends Forever!
