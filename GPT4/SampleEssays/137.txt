Dear radio station, 
I heard you are holding a competition recently, I loved to be engaged in this opputinity of making our society a better place. I should be the winner because i have some great ideas of benefiting the most from the "one-year supply free chocolate" price. If i successfully get the chance, i will cooperate with the government and persuade the politicians to give us a great place to give the free chocolates out. A great location in my opinion is a place with plenty outside area which i can put tables and chairs, plus a great view that every one can enjoy the scenery. In addition, i won't just give out chocolate bars for free, there will be plenty chocolate products, different shapes, and different food which are made of chocolate. For example, chocolate bar, chocolate cakes, chocolate milk, chocolate ice-cream, and many more. When the selling part adds in, based on my fabulous marking skills, i will make the chocolate shop a hot area which people come and enjoy chocolate while chating with friends and taking gorgeous pictures. The ones that came would be addited to this free and relaxing place, and will gather more and more friends to come and have free chocolates. My ultimate goal is to let the citizens in my region know that there is a great place where you can get delicous chocolate for free and entertain those who comes. There's an old saying, "one passes ten, ten passes hundred." I believe that in a short period of time, lots of people will be attracted and be willing to spend their time at my shop. 
Hope to hear from you soon, and it will be a pleasure to operate this chocolate shop for you. 
Kind regards, 
Adrian Huang
