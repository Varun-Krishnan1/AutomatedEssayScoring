Plastic bags have been a negative impact on human life and wildlife over the years. It has caused pollution to arise and has endangered a lot of species both on and off the land. According to recent studies, scientists have shown that banning plastic bags in some countries' supermarkets has decreased the amount of plastic waste and pollution in that areas. This evidence shows that banning plastic bags could improve our environmental health in many different ways. Like other countries, Our school should try to do the same by banning plastic bags and making a difference in our society for a cleaner environment. We could start by limiting plastic bags and replacing them with other recyclable bags when going out. We could always keep one in your purse or backpack would be beneficial because you will always have one ready, even if you weren't intended to have one that day. We could also make posters around the neighborhood, spreading our word with posters so that we could make this impact bigger. Even though our school is a small society, I believe that we will be able to spread our words and our actions around the country so that we will have a chance of living in a cleaner and healthier environment.
