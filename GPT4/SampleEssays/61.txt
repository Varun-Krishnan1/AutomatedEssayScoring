Once again, staring blankly at the TV screen, I sighed hesitantly while looking at the weather forecast. "Heavy rain with thunderstorms..." uttered the news reporter with a slight smile plastered on her pale face. As I looked around, time seemed to freeze, nothing moving at all, with the television noise echoing murderously inside my brain. Knock...knock...knock... The front door creaked as I reluctantly stood up, peeking through the door hole. Blurry movements were seen outside as I curiously open my eyes wider, seeing a figure of a towering woman waving at me.

Since nervousness was cunningly obstructing my thoughts, I steadily unlocked the door. To my surprise, the international superstar singer was standing in front of me with her glossy black bucket hat on combined with sunglasses, covering her eyes. "H-h-h-hi," I stuttered anxiously as I looked down to the floor. "Hello! Nice to meet you, I have heard all sorts of stories about you. You are a journalist right..?" she smiled sweetly while staring at me. As a response, I just stood there while obediently nodding to her question. I felt like being violently sucked inside a small, dimmed room with no escape while still showered in confusion yet exhilaration. "May you show me around your house?" the woman asked politely with her eyes freely wandering around my house. "I would love to!" I exclaimed excitedly as I led her into my office.

"Beep...beep...beep..." the alarm clock rang deafeningly as I jumped right up from the bed in horror while scanning continuously around the room. No sign of any human being... So was it all just in my imagination?
