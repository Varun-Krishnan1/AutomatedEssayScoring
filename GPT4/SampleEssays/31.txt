Plastic bags is a bad thand harn things on the sea,you would know it some of the tourtise and fish would be eat plastic bag because they had thought the plastic bags are they food and eat the plastic bags.The fish and the toutise eat the plastic bag.The bird would eat the fish and feed the baby bird, they can die when they are eating a lot of plastic bags. The fishingman would have to have a lot of plastic fish, and eat and sell the fish for the people, When we eat a lot of plastic bags, we would die by plastic bags too. I suggest that the plastic bags would banned at my school, and always bring your own bags. It can help the earth and help the tourtise and the fish to keep the sea too.
