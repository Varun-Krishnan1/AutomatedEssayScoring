To the radio station,
   Good afternoon, how are you today? 
   It's my pleasure to write this email to you, explaining why I should win the competition and what I will do with the whole year of free chocolate. 
   On warm days, when the temperature is just good for sports. I would like to give out my chocolate to my classmates, teachers, neighbors, and every passenger. Spread love and joy all over the world, and do as much as I can. 
   Chocolate has always been my favorite on cold days. Enjoying the lovely snow outside while having chocolate is one of my most pleasant things. It helps me to have more energy to face the cold wind and get ready for a new day of hard work. I can also make hot chocolate with free chocolate. What's more, it will be more joyful if I can share the warmth in my heart with a bar of hot chocolate given to those who work hard even it's snowing heavily outside. Let's imagine the happiness of every normal and common face.
   Furthermore, if I win the competition and get free chocolate for a year. I will donate some of the chocolate to poor people in some areas, such as the middle east. These people are suffering from wars, diseases, and hunger. Children die for not having enough food. I just can't bear to see more tragedies happen all around the world.
   Generally speaking, I really want to win the competition and share my reward with the world. I'm just a student, I can't make the world better. But I want to try my best to help the people around me. Sharing the happiness that I have in my life. Thank you for letting me have this opportunity!
