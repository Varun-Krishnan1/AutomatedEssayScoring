Elon Musk is a light-skinned in his fifties with brown hair. He is known as a successful entrepreneur and founder of companies such as Tesla and Spacex etc. . He is currently the richest man in the world and is a generous philantrophist. Tesla is a company that creates electric vehicles that won't be as harmful to the planet and Spacex is a company that engineers spacecrafts. Elon Musk is a hardworking person that I look up to.

If I were to see Elon Musk I would ask him what the key to sucess is. I would like to ask him this question because he inspires me to become a successful person that can impact the world in a positive way. I would like to take this chance to learn so I can be directed in the right direction to becoming a sucessful person.

One thing I would like to show him in my house is my rocket model. I would show him this because I am a big fan of his work and accomplishments, such as creating the first reusable rocket. This can save millions and millions of dollars as the spaceship can now be reused instead of being single use.
