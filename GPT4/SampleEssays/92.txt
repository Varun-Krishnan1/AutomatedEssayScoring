Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most famous soccer player on the planet, is here at my house. He's a tall, fit and also extremely physical person. His body is covered by muscles, abs, and he's literally over 180 cm tall. Ronaldo has been one of my favorite soccer player since i was a kid, i was amazed by his skills, playing style, a striker that every defender will have to aware playing against him. He's famous because along with Messi, they're known as 2 greatest of all time soccer player. He's also famous because he never gives up, even though he have a heart problem when he was 15 years old, he still work hard, overcome his problems and challenges to prove himself. Went through the surgery and train to show the world who he is, and inspired a lot of people in the world, including me. I would like to say to him that he's a fabulous soccer player that every kid wants to be like, and that I very admire him, his passion and hard working really means a lot to me, and he teached me about a lesson that i'll never forget in my life, never give up.  I would like to show him my soccer collection in my house and in my room. I have a Real Madrid 2015 away kit, my football shoes including the mercurial superfly x, and many more. In conclusion, Cristiano Ronaldo is a person that people should look and follow, because of his charateristics, personalities, from a normal kid in Portugal to one of the best soccer player of all time.
