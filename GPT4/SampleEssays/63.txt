                                                                                                                                                   A famous person comes to my home
Last Saturday, I opened the door after I heard the knocking sound. I was extremely surprised when I saw the person standing in front of the door.

This person wore a formal dark-blue suit, he was a little bit fat, but the two big eyes and his smile made him looked friendly. It was Lang Lang, a famous pianist that I really love. He was popular, not only for his fantastic playing skills, but also for his characteristic. He established and participated in many charities for people around the world that are interested in playing the piano.

I smiled to Lang Lang and guided him to my living room. When he saw the big piano standing on the floor, he walked to it and touched the keybord gently. A piece of beautiful music flew to the sky. "Your piano is really nice.", Lang Lang said. I sat down and played a famous classical music to him. He praised and taught me how to play better. I also showed him some of my favourite music and asked him to give some comment. "There are a lot of people that play Mozart's music, but how to identify which is better?", I asked Lang Lang a question, and he was like a teacher that explained to me patiently. 

Lang Lang was a guider. He impressed me a lot and I felt enjoyable to stay with a person that also love music.
