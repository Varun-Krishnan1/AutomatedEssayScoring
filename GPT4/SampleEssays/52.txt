A celebrity came over to my house last week on monday. He's a famous actor in one of my favourite television shows which is very popular. I used to watch that show everyday after I come home from school. He came over because he's friends with a family member and wanted to come visit. He has brown curly hair is quite tall and He was wearing blue baggy jeans and a grey sweater. When he came over I first greeted him and sat him down in my living room for tea and biscuits. I asked him quite alot of questions about his acting career and what he likes to do. I asked him, "is acting fun?" and "have you got any new movies coming out?" and we had a conversation about our hobbies and diffrent sports we like to do. He told me acting is so fun but it also brings on different challenges such as the ability to express and feel different emotions.
Later on, I gave him a tour around the house and I showed him my bedroom first and explained what my posters were and showed him all my favourite clothes and my jewelry and bag collection. After I showed him my bedroom I than showed him my kitchen and gave him my favourite recipes and snacks. I then introduced him to my pet dog and we went out to the garden to walk my dog, fed and played with him. I then showed him the trees and flowers in my garden and he helped water and plant some new ones. Afterwards, we headed back to the living room and had more snacks like chips, fries, cakes and more. He asked if we could continue to hang out since he had a really enjoyable time so we decided to watched some television and shorlty after I showed him to the door and he left and headed home in his limousine.
