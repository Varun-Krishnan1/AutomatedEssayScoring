     My favorite superhero is from a video game called Genshin Impact.His name is Cyno. He is very smart, stong, and good looking. People who breaks the law fears him, because he will make sure that justice is served.
    General Mahamatra Cyno is a young adult with white hair, bright red eyes,tan skin, and wears a headpice inspired by the Egyptian anubis. A brown and gold polearm simmilar to a paddle is his weapon. He is a high rank scholar from a very famous academia. The general Mahamatra's role is to judge people that brakes the law.
     Not only is he very smart but very strong too. He received a blessing from the god to use elemental powers. The Electro element was blessed to him one day. The electro powers that was blessed to Cyno was used very frequently at desert theves. The desert is not a very safe place to live, unfortunately, the general lives there and often get ambushed by a bunch of theves. When surrounded by enemies, Cyno will unleash and elemental burst making him a lot stronger. Now using electro claws as his weapon, he slices through his enemies creating a lot of damage.
      If someone ask me about my favorite superhero, it would definitely be Cyno. He is basically everything you need in one person. Not only is he strong, smart, and good looking. He also tries to lift up the pressure by making (terrible) jokes!
