These years,many supermarkets begin to ban the plastic bags.As for our school,I think we also need to stop using it .Here are my reasons.
First,plastic bags is really harmful to the environment.As we all know,plastic is a kind of material getting from fossil.It takes a lot of time for plastic to get into the earth.Even if it get into the earth,it is also bad to the ground,it can make the ground become worth.Further more,there wasn't any nice way to get the plastic in to another kind of materials.If we throw it into the sea,many sea creatures will eat it by mistake,this may kill a small but valuable life.If the number of the sea creatures decrease, it will also have a big influence on human ourself.
Second,the number of the used plastic bag each year is a lot.Each of us is just one of the seven billion people living onthe earth.Although maybe we just use one plastic bag,the total number is still really shocked.Before we use it we should think about it bad influence.
Third,it is really inconvenient for the cleaner in our school.Most of the plastic bag can ohly be used once,so the whole number of it in our school per day must be huge,this can be a large work for the cleaners.They help us to keep our school clean so why don't we do something to help them feel less stressful?
Further more,some scientists mentioned that some of the plastic are poisonous.This means they are bad for our health,so why do we use them?
All in all,protect the environment is just protect ourselves.Maybe banned using plastc bags will be kind of inconvinient but please understand a thing,that is,the every environmentlly friendly actions you do is just saving the planet for our children.So maybe you can buy a new bag which is made of cotton or cloth instead of a plastic one.Please obey the new school rule.
