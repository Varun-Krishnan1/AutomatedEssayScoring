Ding Dong!  The doorbell rung.  I stand up and walked to the door.  Through the eyes, I saw a man, about 1.91 meters high was standing in front of the door.  I opened the door and the man walked in.  Man!  Is that Stephen Curry!, I could not believe my eyes!  Suddenly, I don't know what to do because I had never met a star face to face before.  My face was filled with joy, and I stammered, "S.. Steph?  Are you really Steph Curry" he smiled and said, "Yes I am!  I saw your video on twitter of you playing basketball, and you are good!  So I came here to see the real person!" I want to tell everything aout me to him; I don't know what to say!  "You are my idol Steph," I said, "Every game you played in the 2022 playoffs, I watched them all!  In the finals, you and your team played fantastic!  You are right, no one wants to meet the warriors this season!" He laughed, "Yeah, Me and the Warriors will try to get the champions next seasons!" 

Suddently I remember I still haven't asked him for his signature!  I ran upstairs and go tmy basketball, then I asked him for his signature.  He is a very nice man, when I aked for his signature he signed it for me without saying anything!  Some players wouldn't have any reactions when you asked for their signature.  Then, I showed by Steph Curry poster to him.  he seems very happy.  Last, we went down to the court.  He taught me some of his classic movements, and he went back to America.  "Today was like a dream ... I've never though that I would meet face to face with a famous star."
