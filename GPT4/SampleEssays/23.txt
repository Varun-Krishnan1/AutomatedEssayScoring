Do you guys realise the damage that is being done by simply the use of plastic bags? Don't get me wrong, it definetly makes life a lot easier, but recent study has shown that the amount of plastic use has increased by a drastic rate and is and the ocean is becoming more of a place to dump plastic rather than an actual habitat for sea animals to live in. If fact, you don't need a study to show you this, just look at the internet, or possibly even your own beach, because this problem is a global issue, meaning that everyone will be affected. Some people may be more vulnerable than others but it will affect everyone no matter what. The best solution to this problem is to begin now, the sooner we act, the easier it will be to fix this issue before it becomes a bigger problem, and one of the best ways to do it is by beginning to educate young children to be more environmentally friendly. Passing it on to future generations is important because this problem won't be fixed in a lifetime, and I doubt that it will be fixed in many other generations to come, but beginning now to teach our children how to live a more sustainable life for the world by eliminate plastic use in schools to ensure that the progress has begun, because it's one thing to cause a catastrophic problem... But it's another thing to make it irreversible.
