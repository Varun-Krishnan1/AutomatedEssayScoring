What if a famous person came to my house? I would definitely want it to be Lebron James, he's (in my opinion) the best basketball player on this planet. He's bald, dark skinned, and very strong, he would tower over me and all I would say is, hi. I would look so shy, but on the inside, I wanted to hug him until he got sick of it, everything he's done for his team, his fans, is just so inspiring. I would first show him my basketball jerseys, I have loads of them! Then, I would go straight to my Lebron-inspired room, while asking him to sign my shirt. Finally, I would make him a delicious meal. Steak, lobster, and ice cream! Lebron is an amazing person, loving, caring, and obviously, an amazing basketball player, but he wasn't this joyful. His life story was among one of the most inspiring I have ever heard, so allow me to tell you about it. Lebron James grew up with his mother, they were homeless, Lebron has no other option but to skip school and help out and earn money for both of them. He played American football, and for a while, he was pretty good at it. Until one day, one of the coaches asked if he wanted to stay at his house for a while, until Lebron and his mother could get back on their feet, they agreed. Lebron eventually grew out of football and started playing Basketball, until he got in a High school team and dominated. Lebron then got into the NBA and continued to push off everyone in his way, until he became who he was now. Lebron James is truly an amazing, astonishing, and awesome person, and I would love to actually meet him in real life.
