Summer is usually the best weather because you can go to the beach with your family or friends. And you can also eat lots of ice cream, play water guns and go to the water park to play and because it is hot. Winter is a very cold weather, so you have to wear lots of clothes when you go outside. Christmas is in winter, you can go out and see the snow, building snow man, throwing snow balls with your family or friends. And you can also drink hot soup. When you go home, you can take a hot bath. Summer is my favorite season.
