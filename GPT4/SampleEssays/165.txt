If there is a famous person come to my home. He would be wearing his own brand, he will also wear a cap. He is famous because he sings so well, acts well, and even he writes good songs. Besides, his personality is good, he likes to help people, and when he faces something hard, he will do his best to do it well. On the other side, when he felt sadness, he won't tell others, but just faces it himself, also he is a very great listener. Because of his personality, so he is famous all over the world.
I would tell him "It's okay to be not okay", just tell us if you feel bad, we will always be on your side, when you face back, we are all there and waiting for you. At the last, I would show him a picture of us, and ask him if can sign here or not, and also a letter that I write to him, to tell him to add oil, write more songs for us, and continue to be singer-songwriters.
