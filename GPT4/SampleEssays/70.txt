The superhero I'm telling you today is Captain America. 

He is the best superhero I have ever seen or heard of. Captain America only excist in movies and books. I really admire Captain America because he is very smart perso and he is on the good side. I also admire him because he saved a lot of people in the movie and books. The special skills that captain America have is that he can ran super fast and his shield is a weapon and an armour to defence and attac. He is a superhero because in this movie Marvel, there was a good and helpful team member of fighters. He has this really cool armour. his armour's colour is blue and red. his helmet is an oval shape. His shield is the best thing out of the armour. In the middle of the shield is a red star and around it is red and blue stripes. And when he threw his shield away, the shield would come back to him. He superpower is mainly his shield. When he misses the enemy he can always try hiting the enemy again until he gets the enemy. I believe he was the captain of his team. In his team, everyone was a superhero and had good superpower, but I think Captain America is the best superhero in the superhero history. And when trouble comes, he is always there to help.

If you have never heard of him, you can go on the internet and search him up.
