Have you ever imagine a famous person comes to your home? I have. I have imagined a famous person comes to my home who is a very beautiful woman. Her appearance let people think she is very mature but a bit dangerous, like roses, beautiful but harmful. She is very famous in Hollywood as she has acted in about 30 character which are all apprciate by the film critic as well as the audiences. When she arrived, I will welcome her in front of my daimon and start chatting with her. I would probably talk questions about the movie that she have acted in. For example, how hard she was when she was doing some dangerous action in the film, has she ever met some nasty actor, what does she usually do before filmimg a movie, etc. These questions are able to let me know more about filming is not that easy, but needs a lot of effort and patience. After chating with her, I will invite her to come into my room and show all the postures, cards, magazines which all about her in order to she how much I like her. At last, I will have lunch with her and welcome her to come next time. It must be an excited experience if it is true!
