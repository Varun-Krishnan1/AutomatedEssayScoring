          Everyone has their own superhero.It could be their parents, movie character or any people in their life.In fact, my favourite superhero is my father.
          My father is a ordinary man who has big eyes and strong muscle .He does not have amazing skills or special skills.However he has very strong sense of justice.One day night I went shopping with my father, when we came back home we saw a car parking at the door of our neighborhood.Suddently a tall man got off the car and he draged a young woman.And then, this man begain to hitting her and said some bad words. The woman cried ang did not do any aginest to him.
          There were not someone here excepted I and my father.My father did not think too much,he went straight up and pull the man and asked me to call the police.
Later,policemen came and asked my father  some questions afterwards they  took them to the police ststion.
          Therefore,my father is my superhero.
