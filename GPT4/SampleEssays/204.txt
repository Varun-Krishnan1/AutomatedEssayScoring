If a famous person comes to my home, I think that person will be Vox Akuma. He is tall and thin, he has long hair with black and some red parts on it and yellow eyes. He is a vtuber and he has a lot of stream that has some fans welfare, like he would answer different question that his fans asked and he might do something that the fans asked him to do. Let fans feel happy and satisfied is what he always do and I think that why he his famous.
If Vox comes to my home, I think I couldn't think of any words to say, because I might be too excitied then my brian would be blank. But if I must going to say something, I think I will say how glad and excited I am, I don't think I would say I like or love he because it's a bit embarrass to say it out. And I think I must ask he why he will come to my house.
I remember he likes dogs, so I will show him my dogs and my pets, although I think my dogs going to show themself before I show them to Vox, they welcome everyone to my home. Next, I will show him my memento about he and his teamate, it's kind of hard to imagine what he will say or respond, but it must going to be the most unforgetable's thing happened in my life.
