 Plastic bags are very important in our daily lives. A lot of people all over the world have been relying heavily on plastic bags, they would rather buy a shopping bag instead of bringing their own. Owners of supermarkets from different parts of the world have banned plastic bags in their own supermarket as they know the terrible aftermath of using plastic bags. Seeing supermarkets banning plastic bags, I suggest perhaps we could follow their lead and ban the use of plastic bags in our school. 
  Firstly, plastic bags take up a lot of time to decompose. Most people would try to burn plastic bags, but it is very hard to completely break it down. It is one of the hardest things to burn down, according to experts. We as students often use plastic bags, we probably dispose around 3 plastic bags once a week, those plastic bags will still be around in 2070! 
  Secondly, plastic bags are extremely dangerous to marine animals. Addressing the amount of plastic bags we use in our daily lives, there were at least 10 plastic bags being littered around, and you might never know where they might end up. It might end up in the ocean or even in your backyard! The problem is that most plastic bags end up in the ocean. As plastic bags are very light, they might end up in the ocean. There are multiple news of sea turtle eating up plastic bags because they think the plastic bags are jellyfish. Besides this, there are a lot of news about fishes and seabirds getting caught up in plastic. This have caused a lot of animals to die, and seriously disturbing marine life. 
  The extreme usage of plastic bags is a very important problem in the world. Even though they are more cons than pros, people are still not addressing this problem. In order to reduce the amount of plastic bags, I highly recommend the ban of plastic bags in our school. This could help the pollution by a large margin.
