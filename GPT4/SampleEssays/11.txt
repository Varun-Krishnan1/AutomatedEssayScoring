In the dream I was in a huge and beautiful castle, I ate ice cream and played in the garden. In my dream my sister, mom, pets, dad and aunt is in there. In the dream I also saw a pack of wolves being tamed by my sister, maybe because I know she loves dogs. I also rolled in the green grass playing with my dogs. Then I skipped around the hallway wondering what to do, so I went to eat a grand lunch with my family. When I first took a bite suddenly I woke up feeling confused i thought I was eating lunch in the morning.
