     It has always been my dream for MrBeast to visit me. He looks a little chubby, with a beard and rich looking smile on his face. MrBeast usally appears in short pants and a T-shirt with a beast logo on it. He is always funny and has a contagious smiley face. That's why it has always been my dream for MrBeast to come to my house.
     Once he arrives, I would prepare a huge beast logo made of legos and sing the MrBeast song to him with my friends. And with a box full of beast burgers would make it perfect. I would show him all my lego creations and minecraft pixel arts featuring him and his friends.It would always be my honor to be friends with MrBeast after he pays a visit to my house.
     All in all, I am a huge fan of MrBeast, and wish that he becomes my friend. I will show him how much I liked all his videos and posts. Finally, it would be my honor to have MrBeast come to my home.
