The door bell rang in my house. I quickly ran to the door, and I saw Erno Rubik, the man who invented the Rubik's Cube. He looked smart, and he exactly looked like the man on the internet. Yes, the man in front of me was deffinitely Erno Rubik, the man who invent the Rubik's Cube. I was so happy to see him! I was a huge fan of the Rubik's Cube, and I always wanted to meet him. I was so suprised, I couldn't even say a word. Infact, I wasn't even breathing air. After a few moments later, words finally came out of my mouth. I told him to come inside. I told him that I was a huge fan of him, and the Ribik's Cube. I also asked him how he invented the Rubik's cube. After we talked for a few mins, I told him to stay there, and I brought my Rubik's cube. I showed him how fast I can solve it, and he was inpressed. I asked him more questions, until it was his time time go. I walked with him out the house, and I waved good bye. It was the best time I ever had in my life.
