One day I got back home from school,I sat down in the sofa as usual,then someone knocked at the door. I was so suprised because my parents are at work and I never socialize in school.I was scared and looked through the cat eye on the door.It's my favorite artist! She has hazel brown wavy hair,green-ish blue eye , small red lips and a nose with some frackles on it. I was so happy that I forgot to talk for a second, then i said:"Uhhh hi! do you want to come in ? You are my favorite artist and the person I want to become the most!" She laughed and sai:"Okay,I heard about you in an art competition." Then I showed her some of my art and a drawing of her in my room . She looked happy and said:"Is that me? Awwww it's so adorable.Can I please keep it?" I said:"Ofcourse! It's my pleasure that my art is liked by you" We had a great time in my house and then she left and said:"I am sure that you will become someone as great as me!"
