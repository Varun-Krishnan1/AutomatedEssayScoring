    Last week, I won the first prize in the international piano contest. As a reward, I have an opportunity to invite Lang Lang to my home and have dinner with him. Lang Lang, a world-famous musician, is my idol since I began learning to play the piano. I admire his talent and I often watch his shows time and again in order to improve myself.
    When Lang Lang comes, to my surprise, I find he doesn't wear black suit. Instead, he wears a blue T-shirt, just like a big brother in our neigborhood. He is so kind and polite, and talks to me like a friend. He shares his stories of childhood and answers me a lot of questions. We play a piece of song together, and take a photo.
    Before he leaves, I tell him:" I will keep practicing and one day I'm going to play with you on your concert." He says:" I'm waiting for you." I will never forget this fantastic evening.
