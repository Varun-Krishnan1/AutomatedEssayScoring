  Bates are the strangest animal in the world.Their fur are black and grey,and have two big wings that help them fiy.Besides, bates are the only mammel that can fly.Futhermore,they have two big ears like triangle, and they help them use echo to catch food and find the way home .Their eyes are very big so they make them a little bit cute, but their eres are useless in the dark night. They also have two hands which have three fingers on each hand but no use at all.Their feet are also very big, and they help them sleep safely.Their look are so strange that I even don't know why god would make them.
  Not only their look is very strange, but also the place they live is very strange.Bates live in the cave .The cave is very cold,wet and dark.They often sleep in morning and catch food at night. They always sleep upside down and use their toes to hang themselves on the top of the cave like a ice cone. However, sometimes bates' toes cannot hold their weight and then they will fall down from the top of the cove.So that's why bates are all very small and light ,if they are too heavy they will fall down from the top of the cave ,drop on the ground and maybe die. So that's another reason why I think bates are very strange.
  Bates' look and the place they live are all very strange. That is why I think bates are the strangest animal I've ever seen.
