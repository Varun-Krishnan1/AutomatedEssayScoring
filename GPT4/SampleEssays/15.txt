One of the reasons that plastic should be banned at our school is because plastic bags have become a hazard for all living creatures, it takes hundreds of years to decompose. This is also one of the biggest polluters of the ocean. Millions of animals are killed by plastic every year because most of the plastic we use ends up in landfills or the ocean, the plastic takes a very long time to decompose because it is man made and not natrually produced in nature. There are only a few species of animals that can decopose the plastic but there is already 8 billion tons of plastic in the ocean and on land. Humans make 10 million pecies of plastic every day and if we do not stop using plastic there would be mass extinction of animals on the planet in a short amount of time. Another reason for our school to ban plasic is because most plastics are non renewable and contribute to climate change. Climate change is the change in tempratures and weather around the world. climate change destroys the places the animals live and therefore the animals will have nowhere left to live. Reducing the use of plastic or just not using it at all, will greatly benefit the world be lowering the CO2 emissions and plastic would not end up in the ocean and the land we live on.
