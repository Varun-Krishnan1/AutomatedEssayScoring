One day,a man knocked at my door in a hurry.I opened the door immediately,and noticed that he is my favourite Chinese writer Lu Xun in amazement.It's impossible!He actually died on October 19,1936,almost one hundred years!I stared into his eyes--he was calm.His black short hair,black eyes,even smiling,all of them were telling me one thing:it's not a dream.He looked like stars shining in the night sky,just like his works.His books described and satirized the old Chinese society,this is why he is so famous.
"Hello,sir.What can I do for you?"I welcomed him with a smile,"Welcome to my home.I am a big fan of your books.I very appreciate your intellect.Can we start a conversation?"He agreed.
After he came in,I found out one of his books and showed him."Look!This is your book."I handed him that."You are one of the most famous writter in all over the world now!Congratulations!"But he just smlied,without a word,and put the book in his pocket.
