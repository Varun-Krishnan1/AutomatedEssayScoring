Plastic bags have become one of the most usual thing we used in the supermarket. It's true that it makes our life more conveient, but we can't ignore the damages it brings to our environemnt. We need take our  responsibility to protect the earth. As being a student, we can start to protect our environment by not using plastic bags in our school. 

We have seen a lot of news and articles about how animals died because of accidently ingest those plastic bags. Plastic bags are really diffcult to decompose. It takes around 300 years to let them decompose completely. So as the numbers of plastic bags being used goes up, there will be more and more of them appear at the site of the sea. It creates a huge ocean pollution that kills thousand of animals because of lack of oxygen in the ocean. Imagine you can't breathe suddenly and you can't do anything for it. It feels terrible, right? That's what the animals under the sea feel when there is a ocean pollution. So for the future of our ocean, for our society, for our planet, please stop using plastic bags! 

Moreover, producing plastic bags require lots of time and people and it is a waste of natural resoures. It seems better to use the natural resources which is scaricty for today society for electricity and heating rather than use it to produce a product that need such a long time to decompose. 21st century is being called as our generation, so it's our responsibility to protect the environment for the next generation.
