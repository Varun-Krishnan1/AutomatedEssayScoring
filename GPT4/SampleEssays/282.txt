       When I was a child,I was obsessed with the superheroes at Marvel Studios,and there is a wild variety of heroes at Marvel Studios,among which most impressed me is the superman.
       Superman has a enormous size of body,with a blue tights suit and a red cloak,which make him really handsome.Superman also has many amazing skills during the movies.To commence,superman can fly up to a high place,even to the sky,that is why he can easily catch the enemy.Secondly,he has strong power.He can hit the building seriously,superman will use this skill to kill the bad people,and that is really cool.
       As far as I am concerned,the reason why I admire the superman is not only because his powerful skills,but also his helpful and caring.I still remember one day he needed to catch the enemy,however,he met an elderly person,her cat was in the tree,and it is really a simple thing as far as I am concerned.Notwithstanding,superman stopped catching the enemy and help the elderly person.
       To sum up,superman is the person who I most admired.
