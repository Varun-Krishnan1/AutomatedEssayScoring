                                                                                                                                         A Famous Person Comes To My Home
  For this essay, I will imagine that the world chess champion Magnus Carlsen comes to my home. He is neither tall nor short, has short hair and a very cleanly shaved beard, and does not wear any glasses (despite having played a lot of chess). He is famous because, well, he is the world chess champion.
  If he comes to my home, I would say: "Hello, may I have just one chess game with you now?" By his nature, he will say yes, of course. After that, I will film the whole chess game to post it on Youtube sometime later. Sometimes, chess grandmasters will play some very strange openings to most people, so I will let him explain what openings were played in that game. I'd also like to make progress in chess, so I will talk to him during the game to gather ideas for the game from a chess grandmaster. 
  Grandmasters are always very obsessed with chess, so honestly, I do not know what to show him in the house, because in my house, there is only one chess board, and I have no chess books in my house after all. Despite the fact that I have nothing much to show him in my house, I will let him recommend some chess books for intermediate players.
  This is all I will do. What will you do if Magnus Carlsen came to your house?
