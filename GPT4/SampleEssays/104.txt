Dear Tom,

I hope this email finds you well, I have received your email, this time I am writing to you to talk about my house and neighbourhood. It is commonly believed that houses are like a habour for people, where a place for 'ships' to have a rest as well as a place to look for accompany.

To begin with, my house is an apartment in which you can find my parents and I living inside it. It is located at the fourth floor where the sun is at the perfect angle, thus there are sufficient sunshine in the apartment. Secondly, living in a big community means there are variety of buildings around me. In addition, there are many neighbours around me too. Most of them have the same interest as me - basketball. Playing basketball with them every afternoon is a way how I spend my leisure time. Lastly, the problems of people treating their pets in a wrong way have been brought to sight in my community. Whether it be how people not having the sense of responsibility to put away their poops or letting them bark in the evening.

As a conclusion, despite that there are problem affecting my daily life but I still like living here. Please keep in touch. I will keep you updated with my neighbourhood stories.

Warm regards,

Steven
