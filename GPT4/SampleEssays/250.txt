Hanyu yuzuru is my superhero. He is a beautiful Asian who is tall and thin but very healthy and his body was full of muscles.When he was performing it makes me think of a fair who was dancing on the ice.He is a figure skating alter who is two Olimpic Games' gold medal' s owner and he has been at the top of the game for 7 to 8 years.He can do a lot of spin and jump on ice such as 4 Lz 4S and so on.Why he is my hero is because the soul in his mind.He never give up even if he was hitted by other skater and badly hurt his coach suggest he not to join the compition,but he still doing it and get a medal.He taught me that never give up and never be proud of yourself . And now he is still challenge himself .We are always a challenger not a champion,If you really love something do it and there is no end.
