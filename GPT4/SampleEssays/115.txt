The strangest animal I've seen was a koala. It is very unique with its chubby fingers like human's. They look very cute on the outside with grey furry body which can climb onto trees and hang on there for a long time. They are very interesting too since they're fingerprints are like humans. They're fingerprints and fingers are built so similar to humans. Koala's like to climb onto trees and stay there for a long time. Other animals cannot grip onto trees for so long that's because they so not have fingerprints and finger's like humans. Koala's have an advantage since they have such a unique and cute hand. Koal's also have two pairs of largae dark eyes which glows. They have large noise which allows them to find food and I think koala's are unique because they have figners built like humans and they are really cute. I love koala's a lot because of they're uniqueness.
