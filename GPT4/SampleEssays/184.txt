Dear Diana :
 I want to tell something very interesting thing , in the last night I got an amagzing dream , that was talking about I got wings and you got a tail in a cave , the detail is I want to go the the park in the forest and we went to do it when we on the roud we met alot of marvelous flower and some animals , we wemt to the deep forest and we found a drak cave . You gass in ther has a tiger or a horron moster , but I thought in there has a money or the other thing .
That was soo drak we can't saw anythings , so we felt curiosty then we wen to the inside fast and we found a tree! The tree said :"Hi there , if you wanted a tai give me your flower , if you wanted a wings give me a small animals ."You gave he a lot of marvelous flover and I cought a bird to gave her . He think very joyful and gave us a tail and wings . You very liked the tail then you changed to be a mermaid to swimed in the water ;I got the wigs then I cha ged to be the fairy . 
We all felt very delighted so we danced and singed . After that my mom very angry and she say :" wake up , go to the school fast !" so the beautiful dream is over . Wish you have a good dram too .
 Best regards 
Bella
