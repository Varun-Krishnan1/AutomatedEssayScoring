Plastic bags aee one oif the most commonly used things in our daily life today. It. makes our work easier and gives us a lot of convience in our daily life. Little do we know that they are difficult and costly to recycle and most end up on landfill sites where they take around 300 years photodegrade. In addition, they break down into tiny toxic subtances that contiminate soil and waterways and enter the food chains where animals accidnelty ingest them. Animals often get confused of bags for foods and consume them, therefore blcoking there digestive system. There were supoorted evidence that large endarged tortoises were found to have suffocated because of the mistaken of swallowing plastic bags in the ocean combined with seaweed. Water pollution are also another huge global problem that was caused by plastic bag. Animals and seas creature are hurt and killed everyday by discarted plastic bags. The public should be informed not to use plastic bags, but to use ecofriendly alternative bags made from fabric, natural fibers and paoer to reduce the problem associated with plastic bags. Therefore, I'm asking all of you guys a favour, please protect these inncoent animals. It all start with a single person in this school, every effort help.
