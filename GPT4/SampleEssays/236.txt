Everyone right now are eating plastic bags!
Since this few years lots of animals are eating plastic, 50% of the animals in there bellys of plastic bags, but just that? No, the ocean also have plastic bage floating on the sea.
It is verey important to us, you might think it is not you business but the animals eating the plastic bage first and then we eat them, it actually means we are eat the plastic. Also the ocean if we don't stop them to use more and more plastic then the ocean will be every dirty and fish will die as well and the most important things is the ecological environment will change.
So, this is what we need to do, for example use a environmental bag or useing the paper box.
Animal don't understand, but we need to understand.
