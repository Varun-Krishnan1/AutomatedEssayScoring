                                                                                                             Platapus the Strange Animal

One day when I went to the zoo with my family, I saw an animal that looked very strange, it had a mouth like a duck and the body was dark brown and some part it brown like the legs. It has four legs or whatever they are, they had sharp pointy things on them at the end of each leg which is it's claws to protect itself and to get food to eat. The animal's name was called the Platapus. It was a native Australian animal which means it was first found in Australia. The animal lives in water. I don't believe that the animal live in salt water but it rather lives in fresh water, like lakes and river. There used to be a lot of them in Australia but now they are named as indangered species. In the zoo I saw it in a tank as in a tank for animals not the tanks they use in the war. I think the strange thing about them is that they have a mouth like a duck but have a body that does not look like a duck. They also have the strange claws to protect and attack. I think that is the most strange thing about the Platapus. But there is still many other strange thing about them like, why is their mouth so long and why is it the colours that it is on their body.
