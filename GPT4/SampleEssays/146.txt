It was the usual day. I was at home, when suddenly someone rang at the door. I came to the door, opened it and saw a beautiful tall man with brown eyes and hair and a lovely smile. The man was Dima Bilan, a famous Russian singer. Dima Bilan took part in Eurovision twice, and even took first place in it in 2008. It was a big surprise for me that he came.
