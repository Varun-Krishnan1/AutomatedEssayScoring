Plastic bags have been a staple to our lifestyle for a lengthy amount of time. Huge amounts can be purchased for very cheap, it's fairly easy to dispose, and can be used for a variety of different things. However, plastic bags are a threat to the environment. The core material, plastic, does not break down and because it's very light, plastic bags are able to get stuck in cracks and crevices of the earth. For example, when these bags float into the sea, or a body of water living things such as fish or turtles might get stuck in the plastic or even start to consume it. Chemicals released by the plastic bags get into the soil and ruin it. In the long run, using plastic bags is not worth it for the environment. The good news is, there are so many more sustainable alternatives to fight this problem! Instead of using plastic bags to bring your lunch, or carry around food, reusable totes or lunch bags are fantastic for the job. Let's say you've just done PE and you don't want dirty clothes floating around your backpack, dry bags make cleaning up super easy. All these replacements for plastic bags lasts, are harmless to the environment, and work the same way plastic bags would. We can all help the world by making small changes together. Let's stop using plastic bags!
