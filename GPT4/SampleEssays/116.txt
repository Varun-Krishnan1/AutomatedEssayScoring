Dear my friend,
I live in Hong Kong and I have been living there for 13 years. Hong Kong is a very well known and small city which tall buildings everywhere. Most people live in tall buildings. I live in an apartment in kowloon tong, Ho Man Tin. My home is on the 46 floor. My neighbores also lives in the same apartment where we get to communicate and chat with them easily since we live very close to each other. Hong Kong is different to other places since people usually live in tall buildings but the peope who live in other places live in houses and low apartments. Something I don't like about my area is that it is very small. ALl the citizens in Hong Kong are very close to each other which makes it so cramped. Sometimes the markets are really skinky and gross because people sell fish, meat and other food. The fish meat and the raw meat makes it disgutsing and disgusting and might make the floor a dirty. Thank you. Hope you have a great time!

Sincerely, Audrey.
