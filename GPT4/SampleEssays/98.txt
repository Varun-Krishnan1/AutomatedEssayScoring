  I loves reading manga and my favourite series is Cased Close, written by Gosho Aoyama. I have lots of things to share with him about the manga series and I would like to show him a tour to my house.

  Gosho Aoyoma is a popular Japanese manga artist, he created lots of masterpiece and one of them is the Cased Close series. It talks about a highschool detective Shinichi Kudo, who was being force to drink some poison that turned him into a child and he's trying to find the antidote in order to returned to his original self. There are lots of things that I wanted to talk to him, but I just want to let him know that his work is a masterpiece and I really enjoyed while reading it. I would like to show him my bookshelf. I bought almost every manga from the Cased Close series and put them neatly from episode 1 to 97 on the shelf. They are my treasures and it helps me to release my stress whenever I see it. 

  Cased Close remains to be one of my top 10 favourite manga/anime ever. Don't push yourself too much, you did a great job on it. I would like to see your upcoming releases.
