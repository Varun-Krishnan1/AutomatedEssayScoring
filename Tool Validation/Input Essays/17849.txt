One day, my soccer team was in the chamionchip game in we facing the lions. At the start of the game I was on the bench I was the worst on my team. After the @DATE1 we were up @NUM1 but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my. The next to quarters went by and it was tie game @NUM2. Half way through the @DATE2 are star player got hurt so coach put me in. I had no due what do I was just chassing the ball. With one minute left I was standing by their goalie and one of my team mates shot the ball zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal my team started to cheer we were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done and horned went off and every one cheered again and lifted me up. That's how patience helped me.
