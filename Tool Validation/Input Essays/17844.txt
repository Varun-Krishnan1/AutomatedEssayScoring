I think patience is a time when you have to be calm. It is also a time of wateing. For some people being patient is extremely hard. But for me it's easy. At times I can be inpatient, but everyone can be. Being patient is kinda new racking, but I manage. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don't like to be patient. with patience comes a reward is you are really patient!
