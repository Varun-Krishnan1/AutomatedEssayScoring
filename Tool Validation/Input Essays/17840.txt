This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, @PERSON1's mom looked sad. "@CAPS1's wrong mom?" @PERSON1 asked. "I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and can't take you with me," mom replied. "@CAPS2 not?" asked @PERSON1. "I don't know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. I'll be back soon," the mom said calmly. With that @PERSON1's mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didn't have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1's dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began  @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and @PERSON1's mom still hasn't returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom.
