She's very tall, pretty, dark skinned and has long hair. She is an actress, and plays in many different movies. A lot of people admire her because she is very talented and is very good at her job. I love her action movies, because she suits an aggressive character. If she came to my house, the first thing I would say is how much I love her and the things she does. I would then ask for her autograph and take a picture with her. I would also ask about her likes and dislikes, as well as what other jobs she has and about her family and how she's doing. Then i would give her a tour of my house and show her the amazing things i got in it, such as my backyard that has a swimming pool, a playground and a garden. I would also show her my room, and show her how many posters of her i have, my big and comfy bed and my trophies and medals.
