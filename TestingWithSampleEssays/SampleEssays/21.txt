                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                               Introduction
                                   
                          
                             The concept of a starter business creating a revolutionary Invertion and or business idea is slim and osme companys might try to either get funds from donations or Scam people out of money these start up companys usually dont have great ideas but sometimes they do.
 
                            
                           The ideas of big and small companys are sometimes flawed they have up's and down's this is just the way things go but big companys have a bigger chance to have better ideas or worst but like ok so imagine this there are 2 companys we will call them red and blu now these 2 companys are fighting over there infrastructure that there father left theme in his will now both ocmpanys have diffrent ideas red has the idea that they should focus on inovating new idea and doing research and blu on the other hand has the idea to take inspiration from ther company that already found great ideas now let say that both companys have to same around the same profit
one day the ceo of blu (Mr.izen) sent a letter to his brother the ceo of red (Mr.ryzen) now Mr.izen said "Hello my dear borther i want to give you shall we say a proposal we can merge our companys into one big company so we can merge our ideas and work plans" the other brother said Mr.ryzen "This is tempting and it could benifit us both but we have diffrent idea so they could go bad together im sorry dear brother but i'd have to decline this offer" 
Mr.izen sent a final letter back and it says "Hello brother i can see ur concern so i will accept ur decline" then Mr.izen secretly sent a man to kill his twin brother then the other brother Mr.ryzen was thinking of the same thing to take over each other's land and they both hired mercenaries to fight and then battle has been going evevn since even after the brothers had passed 


                             In conclusion don't become like what the zen brothers became or you will have a miserable time like the brothers the end.
