My idol's name is Hyujin. If he'd come to visit my house, I bet he will look really handsome and tall. I would want to hear his strong voice and see his amazing dance. I would tell him I'm his biggest fan and really like his red hair. I would show him my room first and tell him I'm also an anime fan. I want him to see my big collection of mangas and figures, also K-pop albums. I would also ask him to watch some anime movies with me, it would be a lot of fun.
