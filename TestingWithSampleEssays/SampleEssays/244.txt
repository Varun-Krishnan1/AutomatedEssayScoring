If a famous person were to come to my house, the person would be mid height but still taller than me; she'll have blue eyes, thick eyebrows, fair skin and short black hair. 
If I had chance to talk to her I would start by saying, "Hii, I'm Ferlin, I can't believe that you're actually here! It's so nice to see you, I just want to tell to you that I love your music so much and I love you and everything you do. Keep up the good work because wether you know it or not your music actually helps people around the world including me" after saying that I'd probably hug her and start showing her my whole house and basically give her a full house tour then lastly I would show her my room;
If she plans to stay around a bit more then I'd probably ask her wether she wants to stay in my room to relax while vibing to some music or if she'd like to go and hang around the living room instead.
