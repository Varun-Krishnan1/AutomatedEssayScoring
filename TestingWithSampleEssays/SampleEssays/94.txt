Dear Friend,

  I had a weird dream and it brought me memories, and I hope I could share it to you, 
 Last night, I was in a dream where I was in the city we used to live in. I went though the beaches and all the shops, the city was so lovely. It brings me memories about our childhood, the playgrounds that we played in, the arcade that we used to spend hours in, and how can I forget the ice cream shop. But when I was in the dream, no one could see me, I was wandering around, everything felt so real. I was amazed, I was speechless. So, for the rest of my dream I traveled across the whole city, and at one point I swear I could see our old school. It brings me nostalgia, and made it made my day. When I woke up, I was happy for the entire day. Oh also, the dream reminded me of something, we haven't talked in a while, should we meet up? I think it would be awesome!

Your pal, Tony
