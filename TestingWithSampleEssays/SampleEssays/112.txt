  There are lots of superheroes that I really admires because of their abilites, skills and experiences. But out of all of them, there is a unique superhero that I likes the most. He is called by the Caped Baldy, Saitama.
  Saitama had a special bald head. He used to explained that it was because he worked out so hard that all of his hair had gotten fewer until he was bald. Saitama has an elastic, yellow suit because it stands out and easy for him to move. He also has some red gloves and a pair of heel with the same colour as the gloves just like most of the superheroes. The main thing that every superheroes will not want to miss is a cape. Saitama has a long, cream coloured cape that reaches until his ankle which represents him. His clothes are quite colourful which made him different than others.
  Saitama has a simple skill that anyone can do it. All he needs to do in most fights is to land a single, direct punch towards his opponents. There are three different types of punch that he uses, a soft punch, medium punch, and the serious punch. He will estimate his opponents' strength and decide what punch he should use. That's also the reason why the name of the series is called One Punch Man. 
  I really admires Saitama because he is a person that is hard working. He sometimes show others repects and he is funny. I likes the way he fights because it's really cool. Just imagine you blows your opponents out by just one punch.  I have mad respects for him. 
  Saitama remains to be one of my most favourite superheroes. He has a strong punch that can send you to an another world, funny and completely stands out in an interesting way.
