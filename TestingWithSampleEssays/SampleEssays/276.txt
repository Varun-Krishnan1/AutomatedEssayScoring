Nowadays, plastic bags almost can be seen everywhere. It does make people's life convenient, but it is also a harm to the environment. We all know that plastic will be left in the environment for a long period, in which we want less production of plastic for sure. I strongly believe that protecting the environment is the responsibility for everyone. In order to achieve this goal, starting from small actions, plastic bags should be banned at our school. Plastic bags are actually not necessary in our daily life, because we have gotten many other choices. For example, they can be substituded by cloth bags. Many supermarkets have already banned plastic bags in recent years. Parents and teachers always tell us to care about the environment. If banning plastic bags does contribute to that, then why not just do whatever we can, and help the world to get better? Again, we have a lot of ways to reduce the use of plastic bags. Using a cloth bag or even a backpack instead of plastic bags will be a better option. I know everyone of us in the school is taught to be kind and caring, so please support the idea of banning plastic bags at school.
