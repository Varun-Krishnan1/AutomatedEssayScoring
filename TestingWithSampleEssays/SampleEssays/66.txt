knock knock knock.

There was a noise on the door. "who is it?" is asked. i opened the door, finding a tall person standing upon me."hhhi." i asked, slowly,as  id he was a thief, but he doesn't look like one. "what is your name?" george had a surprised look on his face. "you don't know me? i am the famlus youtuber George not found!" I looked closely. he was wearing some glasses, a blue t-shirt with the familiar symbol i see him on youtube with. i banged on my head. i thought i was dreaming, but i was not. i was not dreaming. i was looking at a famous youtube face to face! i was shocked, very shocked to see a famous youtuber come to my house one day. â€œif you are really george not found, then  why don't you help me play minecraft for me?â€ i asked, suspiciously as if he was faking as if he was not george not found. we went upstairs, opened my computer, and opened minecraft. he immediately sat down, and started playing. i went to my bedroom, and started doing my own homework. 

Twenty minutes later, I came back to my computer. George was still playing on the computer, but the funny bit was that..... He actually finished playing the gameï¼This time, i actually trusted he was the famous youtuber. i zoomed backin into my room like a cheetah, got a pen and paper, and let him quicky sign my paper, so that i could actually get george no tofund signature! as he finished writing, I was so happy that i jumped like a kangaroo. i told him everything i wanted to tell him, and told him that i want him to stay at my house for two months to help me play minecraft ad other games. i can't believe it. i actually had a celebrity in my house!
