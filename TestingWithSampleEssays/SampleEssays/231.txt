On a cold, Li Bai who was a poemist lived in Tang Dynesty went into my house. He was so cold and faint that he was trubling. I passed a cup of tea to him and let him drink the tea.
He looked fairly strong with a heavy sword. It seemed that he could beat enermy with his tough fist easily. Besides his strong body, he had a wise brain and a great ability in creating the poems. Almost everyone in the world know him because of his fantastic poems. Li Bai's poems are meaningful and profound for students to learn.
I would like to tell him that altough it is interesting to learn the poems which were written by him, I hate to memorize what he wrote. I would asked him to teach me to write a peom and I would try my best to learn if he agreed. 
Last, the stuff that I wanted to show him first is my Chinese book. He must be glad if he saw a number of his poems are exhibited on many pages of paper. And then, I will show him some modern technology such as , mobile phone, air conditional. These are symbol of modern technology.
I hope one day I can meet Li bai.
