One day,the famous basketball player Kobe came to my home.I was very excited because he is very popular  of his basketbll race. I looked at him.He was black and tall. He was very friendly.I asked him to teach me how to play basketball.He agreed and showed me how to play basketball well.I showed him the books about him in my home.He was very happy about it.Looking him very happy,I was happy too.After a time,he continued to teach me.At that time,I can  play basketball better than befor.At that time,we were both happy.It's an amazing time.Kobe not only teached me the movement of playing basketball,he also teached me how to play with your team.At last,he told me that the most important is to do exercises everyday and never give up.I wake up.It was just a dream.
