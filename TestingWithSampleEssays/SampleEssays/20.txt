The strangest animal I have ever seen.
It has the shape of a worm, but it's tilted aside, looking like it's standing. It has the color of white along with some stripes on its back. Wherever I go to zoos, there is always a pool of mud in which muddy animals live, for example frogs. However, there are always a couple of holes in the mud which I found fascinating. When I had a closer look at it, a white shaped creature just appeared. It immediately stick out of the mud and the following 'worms' also sticked out of the mud. It's strange for me as not only does it look like a worm, but it also stands up as if it has legs. Whenever people are near them, they become scared and right away, they go back into the hole again. They stick in and out occasionally and I still don't know why they have this kind of habit. I wonder, how do they eat and how can they stay in the hole for the rest of their lives?
