          When a famous people come to my home,he stand at my door,he has fluffy white hair and beard, and big bring eyes. He looks very serious. I will ask his name,and he tells me his name is Beethoven. he is a talented musician,Beethoven is famous for his song, like "Symphony of desity" I " Moolight Sonata".
          I will tell him, his's songs are famed the world over,he is a great man. I hope he can feel happy. I sdore Beethoven very much. So i will ask him how to oplay the pinano better. I also will telle him go into my house to have a cup of tea.
          I will show him sothing in my house,like my  studyroom, dinning room,and living room. I can teach him how to use TV and cookes, I also can show him my garden.
          I don't believe i will be a famous person in rthe futher, but i can try my best to do.
