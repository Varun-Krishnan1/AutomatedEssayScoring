Dear sir or madam,

The purpose of this e-mail is to offer my oppinion on that plastic bags should be banned at my school.

We know that the campus is a place where teachers and students work and study.A good campus environment can bring us fresh and beautiful atomosphere and help students to a better focous on their study and research.To accomplish this,the activity I am most likely to choose to protect the campus is encouraging students and teachers to not use plastic bags.In my opinion,there are some ways to ban plastic bags.At first,it is a good choice to not buy them at stores in schools.In addition,schools should set up some punishment such as small fines.However,making students and teachers understand the damage of plastic bags is necessary.

I am looking forward to your reply.

 Sincerely
.....
