Fellow students:

Recently, major institutions around the world have been advocated for environmental protection, calling for usage of recyclable materials. As an international citizen, I believe that we should contribute to this global movement. Therefore, I am offcially calling for the banning of plastic bag in our school for the sake of protecting the environment.

Firstly, using plastic bags causes huge burden to local trash-dealing institutions, as plastic is not biodegradable material. It generally takes more than two hundred years to degrade one plastic bag, which severely damage the soil condition and environmental resources. It is irresponsible to abuse the environment in this large extent. Also, for our posterity, they'll have to face a dark and stark environment if we continue to use these resources relentlessly.

Secondly, it will not be difficult or suffering for students to quit using plastic bags. There are several reusable meterials out there to choose. They are better in terms of quality and duration than plastic bags. Promoting these products is easy in school and will not likely to cause any major inconvenience. For example, Putney high school in the state of Vermont, US imposed a comprehensive ban on plastic bags since 2019 and the student council said that they totally accepted the policy.

In a nutshell, I suggest that our school should ban plastic bag in campus. It gives our children a better environment and is a relatively practical policy.
