I would invite Ed Sheeran as he is a good singer and also because he plays the guitar well. Ed Sheeran is commonly dressed in a t-shirt and shorts however he has also dressed up in other types of clothing for music videos. He is a famous singer who has sung songs like celestial and also written songs like little things which was sung by one direction and also love yourself which was performed by Justin Beiber. For instruments he plays acoustic guitar. I would ask him three questions about his career in music. One, how he he got into the music industry and also who made him want to do music? Two, does he have any pets that are alive or dead in his masion?  Three, what his favourite past-time is and finally four what awards is he most proud of that he has recieved that are related to his career such as grammys. If he comes to my house I would show him what I am doing such as my classical guitar skills and also show him my vintage gameboy collection as he has a purple gameboy as I do. I would like him to sing me a few songs also. I will also show him our pool and my room. I would also show him my lego collection as well. That is what ed sheeran looks like, what questions I would ask him and what I would show him around my house.
