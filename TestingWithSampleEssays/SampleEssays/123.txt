 In one of my dreams, I have once imagined a famous person coming to my home...
 The doorbell rang, echoing in the corridoor. However, no one should be coming at this point of the day. Who is outside the door? I strolled to the door, wondering who might be the unexpected visitor. When I pulled the door open, what came into my view was a face I had seen countless times from my books--I would have never imagined seeing him in real life! She is a famous detective fiction author, and wrote many splendid detective novels which I cherish and are kept in my bookshelves.
  "Miss, it's a great pleasure to meet you! I'm a big fan of your books! Why have you visited here?" 
  She smiled and replied, "I'm searching for some inspiration for my new book, and I have heard that there once was a paranormal event which happened in this area. Would you mind telling me about it?"
  I am very glad!" 
  I shared with her the story that everyone living in this area are very familiar with, and showed her all her books I have read.
  I have devoured your novels since I was ten, and since then I was especially fascinated with your works. I love all the amazing characters you have shaped!
  When I woke up from my dream, our conversation still echoed in my mind.
