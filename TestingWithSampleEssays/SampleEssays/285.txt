As the technology developes, people do not bother to reuse, instead, more disposable items are produced such as plastic bags. However, as they are convenient, more supermarkets around the world decide to ban them because of their damage to the environment and human society. I strongly believe that our school should ban the use of plastic bags.

To begin with, plastic is extremely harmful to the soil. This poisonous material takes hundreds of years to be totally disolved in nature. In these years, tiny pieces of plastic can be mixed into the earth, and cause negative chemical reactions. As a result, the soil in particular areas will be less fertile and in bad condition for crops. For instance, human agriculture will be largely affected. This is a serious threat to all species, from tiny insects to large mammals.

In addition, human health can also be in danger because of this material. Since it cannot be disolved, disposed pieces of plastic eaten by microbes in the ocean, can be brought up from the bottom of the food chain to our stomach. After years of saving these tiny pieces in our body, our organs will be seriously damaged by the chemical material.

In conclusion, this threat is surrounding us in our daily life, the best way to avoid it hurting more peolpe, living things and our environment, is to ban it. Save our environment.
