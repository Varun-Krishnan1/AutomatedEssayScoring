Hello, today I'm going to talk about what if a famous person or celebrity comes to my home. So if some celebrity like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is a really talented soccer player comes to my house, I would propably freak out, because the odds of this happening is extremely slim. Cristiano Ronaldo is really tall (taller than my tallest family member which is my dad), he is more than 35 years old now but he still looks very young to be honest. If he ever comes to my home (which he probably never will), I would instantly ask for an autograph and his signature, like any other fan if they ever encountered him, after that though, I would ask him about his life as a extremely famous celebrity. After all the questions are done, I would show him around the whole house, it won't take even half a hour as my house is miniscule compared to his luxury mansion. Everything done, right? No, what I'm doing next might not be the best decision, but I would gift him something super valueble, like a computer or jewellery, after that's done, I would wave goodbye to him and he swiftly leaves. That's all, thank you for reading.
