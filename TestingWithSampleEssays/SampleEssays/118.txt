Banning plastic bags has been a debatable topic among the society and students. While some hold the belief that plastic is harmful to the environment and nature species, others still ignore its drawbacks. However, in order to improve human's life quality, it is crucial to take responsibility of using chemical products such as plastic bags.

First of all, plastic bags take a huge amount of time to fully disintergrate. In other words, if the bags are thrown into the ocean, they still appear there for decades. According to scientist, plastic is estimated to 450 years to be disappeared. Additionally, the mjority of the plastic bags would be dumped to the sea and ocean. Consequently, these bags not only contaminate ocean water, but also obstruct the marine animals. 

On top of that, some sea animals can onfuse between food and plastic bags. For instance, some fish and crabs were reported that they had a lot of small pieces of plastic bottles and bags, which stuck the digestion progress of the animals. Therefore, if we keep continue throwing plastic to the ocean, we would harm the sea animals and ourselves.

From these reasons, it is obvious that we should take the action of banning plastic seriously.
