    There are many famous person in our life , I think it's difficoult for us to visit or play with them . 
    William Whitaker is an artist come form the USA , he is a man with a pair of big eyes ang a long nose , it makes him looks kind and clever .He is famous about his person drawing and I like his drawing very much , they are so beautiful . 
    If he comes to my home , I will told my best friend Kitty to come ang we can talk about the things with art . Also , I will show him my drawing and ask him to teach me about how to draw the person . William Whitaker likes animals very much , so I can shou him my Australian Shepherd dogs called Oreo . It was very cute ang kind and he can have fun with it , I trust he will like it .
    In the last of talking with him , I think I will take photos with him to set down this fantasic time . 
    I want to be an artist in the future too and I hope to meet him in the work .
