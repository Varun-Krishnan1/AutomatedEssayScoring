I think the strangest animal I have every seen is a squid.  It swims in the ocean and is closely related to the octopus.  Both have eight legs, but the squid also has two long tentacles that they use to catch their food and put big chunks straight into their mouth.  

The squid is such an unusual looking animal - it almost looks prehistoric.  It's extremely ugly, with two big eyes close to it's legs.  It has a couple of fins at the top of it's head as well, which helps propel it through the water.  I don't think they are dangerous, but I'd be pretty scared if I came across one in the water.  Squids can actually grow up to 20 metres long, but most are much smaller.

I think the best part of a squid is eating it!  I really love calamari - lightly battered, fried, and served with aioli.  Yum!  Imagine how much calamari you could get from a 20 metre long squid!
