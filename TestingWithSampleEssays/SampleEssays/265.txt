If a famous person comes to my house I wish it would be Ja Morant. He looks very recognizable with his signature hairstyle. Ja is a basketball player in the NBA so he has an ideal height and a fit, robust body. He is also very artistic and has tattoos on his body.
At the time I meet him, I would instantly say that I am a big fan and request a signature from him. After that, I would be extremely curious about his ridiculous bounce and make questions about it. Ultimately, if he agrees to involve in training me, it would be fantastic and makes my day.
I live in an apartment so there isn't much space, but if Ja Morant visits, I would totally give him a room tour of mine. And maybe we can sit down vibing with the music and have a conversation in my cozy room.
