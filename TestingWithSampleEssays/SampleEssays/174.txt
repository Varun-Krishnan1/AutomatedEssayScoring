  Recently, our school have banned the plastic bags. Maybe some of you think it is unnecessary to do a thing like this, so I will persuade you the reason why the plastic bags should be banned at our school.
  First of all, the most core reason, is the plastic bags is quite harmful to the encironment. If a plastic bag is buried in the earth, it will take at least thirteen years to degradate, and in the thirteen years, the area cannot be used by any form.  And it is harmful to the microbes in the earth too. If the microbes die, there will no other things to degradate bags. So it is a thing will not only waste money bt also will be harmful to the Earth.
  If plastic bags are thrown to the ocean, the damage will be greater. The plastic bags will be eaten by sea animals and cause their suffocation. That's really cruel and aching. I don't want any sea animals to suffer the pain like this.
  So if you know the damage of using plastic bags, please! Cooperate our work and don's use the plastic bags, it;s really bad for animals and the environment. It will bring you a lot of unconvinience, I apologize to you. Thank you sincerly.
