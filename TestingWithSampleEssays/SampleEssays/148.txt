            My favorite superhero is the sister in " Incredible". She is a junior high student who has special skills. She is a girl who is quite skinny and has black long hair with big blue eyes. She is a superhero who have many special powers. She is able to be invisible, attack enemies with her power and she is also able to make a big bubble which has the power of protection. In the moive, she used her invisible skill to get close to her enemies and use her attack skill to attack them. If they fight back, she would make a big bubble to protect she and her family.
            I admire this superhero so much because I hope I am able to have the power of being invisible and making bubble for protection, and she is also able to protect her family. Having the power of being invisible is a good way of running away form the people is attacking you without being noticed. Furthermore, having the skill of making protection bubble can protcet not just only me, I can also protect my family. Having these power in these days might not be very useful, but if there is a war going on, it will be the best tool to escape.
