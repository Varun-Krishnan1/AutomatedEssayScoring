If I could choose a famous person that could visit me I would choose Andy Griffiths. Why did i choose him? Because I have admired his books, he is the creator of  "The 13-Storey Treehouse." I have always loved his books since I was a child, about 8 or 9. He even came to my school once, and I got a signed copy of his "The 117-Storey Treehouse". 
  What does Andy look like? He has short black hair, just like in the book. He is famous because he is the author of many children's books including like I said before, The Storey Treehouse's series. He and his friend, Terry Denton, and his wife, Jill Griffiths made the amazing series of The Storey Treehouse.
   What would I say to him? Well I would say I am a big fan of his books, and I love his sense of humor in his books. There are just many things I could say to him, including questions, "How long does it take to make a Storey Treehouse book?" Or 'Do you enjoy writing for young kids?" and many more.
  I would show them my collection of their books, and I would also show them my dog because I think Andy will like him. Maybe I would even show him my room! My room is very neat and tidy (in my opinion), and my bed is really comfy!
