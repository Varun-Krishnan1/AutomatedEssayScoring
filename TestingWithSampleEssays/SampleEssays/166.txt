If a famous person comes to my home, I will probably take a photo with him or her, and show it on the Insturgram. I think they look very handsome like Chris Hemsworth, and i think that the most reason that they are famous is becouse of their songs or movies or even their looks. And if these geys come to my home, I will faint first or say to them that I'm a big fan of his or her's. But even I'm a big fan of them, I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to let them in to my house, one of the reason is that it's a little bit disordly, but if they ask: "Can I come in?" I'll still let them in, but ill quikly tidy up my things. But I still think that I'll faint first and wake up at the hospital,  showing the most embarrassing moment with them. And if they are ok with taking a picture with our family, I'm going to buy the greatest camera in the universe!!!
