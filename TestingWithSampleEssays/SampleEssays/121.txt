  Hello everyone, a lot of you may already knew that in recent years some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags and you may wonder why, so today I'm going to talk about the harm that the plastic bags have done to our environment and why we shouldn't use it in our school.
  As we all know, after shopping in the supermarket, the shop assistant may ask you whether you need a plastic bag. I know it's very convenient at the moment, but when you arrive home you may just throw them away. At last the plastic bags will be bury under the soil. Since it's hard for the plastic bags to decompose itself, it will stay under the soil forever and cause damage to the ecosystem.
  When you are walking by the sea, except for the beautiful sea view, you may also see there are many floating plastic bags. This is what we called "White pollution". Animals living in the sea were finding out eating the plastic bags accidentally, this always lead them to death without other's help. Plastic bags have caused serious pollution to the environment of the sea.
  What will plastic bags do to our school? I believe that you have already seen the plastic bags which were hanging on the tree branches and made it harder for the cleaners to make our campus neat and tidy. But what can we do since the plastic bags are bad for our campus and our world? Here are my suggestions.
  First, find yourself your own shopping bag which is not made by plastic so when you're about to shopping, you can bring it with you. Second, if you saw someone throwing the plastic bag on the ground or into the sea, it won't be nosy if you stand out and stop him or her. This will also do good to the environment. Third, what about spreading the word about the dangers of plastic bags? This may let more people know that the plastic bags are bad for the environment.
  Thank you for reading so far and let's make the world a better place by banning the use of the plastic bags.
