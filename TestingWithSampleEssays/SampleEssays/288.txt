For a long time, plastic bag was part of our daily life. It helps us a lot and we use it in various way. However, some research indicate that plastic bag has serious pollution, which is ture. Therefore, some supermarkets, from different courtries, generally banned plastic bags. From my perspective, I strongly believe that we should stop using plastic bags in our school. 

To begin with, plastic bag might pollute our school. Some research suggest that plastic bag is hard to dissolve. If we lose some plastic bag in soild, it needs to take a hundred years to resolve it. However, there is not a suitable way to recycle or deal with it. Unforturnately, we use huge amount of plastic bags in daily life, which means that plastic bags are easy to become pollution. 

On the other hand, we are more likely to waste plastic bags. We could see that plastic bags are easy to be destructed. It is hard to use one plastic bag for several times. In this case, we have to buy a large amount of platsic bags just for several times shopping. 

Addmittedly, plastic bag helps us in many ways. It is not only cheap for people, but also useful. However, we could use bags that are made by recycling materials. After all, I still suggest students to ban plastic bag in our school. Maybe one person's contribution is small, but together, our contribution will not be ingnored.
