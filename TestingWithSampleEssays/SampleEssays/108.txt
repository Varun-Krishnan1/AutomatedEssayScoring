I like a lot of super heroes I like. But my favorite is super woman. She is just an ordinary girl but when she has a mission to accomplish, it is to save humans lives. She looks like a brave super hero but she is just an odinary girl from the inside. SHe is a really unique girl with gifted talent which I admire the most about her. She wears a red cape which a suit that fits her and looks amazing on her. She has blonde hair with a brave look on her face when she is here to save the day. She has the ability to fly high in the sky so that she can travel quick to fight bad guys. She is also a very strong girl who is able to beat down everyone. Super Woman has a lot of strength when she fights bad guys. I really want to be like her becaue she sets a good role model to the little kids and the older kids who also want to be like her.
