Dear sir or madam,  
   First, I would like to thank you for giving me the oppotunity to attend the competition. I am a huge fan of the story reading radio grogram of your radio station. It would be a great pleasure for me to attend the story telling competion.
   Meanwhile I am quite confident that I could be the winner. Here are some of my advantages. First of all, I used to be a member of the school choir, so according to my music teacher, I have a dulcet voice, which I am proud of. I think it would be easy for me to give my audience a good impression through my sweet voice. Secondly, I am good at imitating, I can add some humourous sound effects in the story I read, in order to create a immersive experience.I am also quite exprienced at reading stories for I am a reporter of the school radio statiom. Finally, I choose to read a classic chapter from the book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, because it fits the theme of the competition most.
    If I am lucky enough to win the competition, I can have a one-year supply of free chocolate, which sounds like a imagionary plot from the story. I am not a crazy fan of chocolate, so I think I will leave a box of chocolate as a prize of the competition. I would like to volunteerly give the ownership of the chocolate to charities and other organizations. They can make the best use of the sweets. For example they can give them to homeless people or orphans to bring them happiness.
    So wish me good luck. I hope I can be
