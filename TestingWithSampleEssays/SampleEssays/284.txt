  In my view, In this convenient day and age, everything proves as quickly as flying, However, pollution is getting into massive trouble. especially plastic bags, plastics are terrible problems for the environment. In addition, some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags. Therefore, I strongly believe, we should ban plastic bags in our schools.
  Firstly, Plastic bags are not only containers but also weapons to kill individuals.Plastic bags are very conveniet things that people will carry,but it is very difficult to break down. That causes extremely unpleasant pollution.If we get the free bags from the school canteen or wherever, the pollution will be more terrible.So stop doing that, ban the plastics bags in the school.
    Secondly,We need to remind we have to save and recycle at all time. Ban plastics bags look like a small ,easy things , auctually that will become an effective things.BAn the plastics bags will help us improve our mind and make the world better.That the reason why should we ban the plastics bags in the school.
     Last things to ban the plastics bags is save the money from the goverment.If we keep using plastics bags,that is a huge money for the goverment. We can use this money to help children and do good things.Isn it a big deal for all individuals.
      In conclusion, we have to ban theplastics bags ,not only for environment,save money but also remind ourselfs,So
