On a sunny saturday morning, l didn't wake up that early that morning but l heard smeone knocking on the door. l just went to open the door, at the first time l didn't realise who was he, l just thought it was the dilivery man, but after l wipe my eyes and seen his face l realise that he wan Wong Kakui(a famous singer in China Hongkong). But l conden't beleve waht l saw beacuse he was dead at 1991s and why his here? L colse the door and make myselve to come down, and open it again l started to ask him "are you Hong Kakui" he replys â€œyes of couse,if l'm not than  who eles l can be. " "Than l ask him why you are here l have seen that you got a acident on a game show at 1991" he said " Now l had a chance to go back and make one of my fans wishs to come ture, but it only last for 2hours. So if you want to show me something lest do them now." okay l anserwd.
Than l let him to get in the house, l starting to show the colection that l got from his rock band and hom self.While l'm showing the things he start to tell me that why he became that famous:"When l was at your age my neboure are moving their house and l went to help them after they left me with a wooden guitar, after l got the guitar l cleaned it up and learn it by my self. After l found that l got a talent on playing guitar so l went to a guaitar compitition and got a forst place. This was my start after l decied to me an musicion l start to creat a band, and named in 'Beyond'. When we published our first albums there was no one likes them, so l decied to birng our selevs to Janpan to develop. When we got there ther was no one know us so l decied to go on a game show and let orthers know our rock band. But on the first show when l was compliting the missions the back of the bord falls and also l falls with it, and sadly my head landed first. That is all about my life itsn't perfect but l belife you can also be the same that as l do ."
