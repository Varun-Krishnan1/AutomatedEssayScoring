  On a sunny day, I heared a person was knocking my door. " Who's there?" I said. " I'm Nora.Can I get in?â€ I thought I might heared this name before, because she was very famous. She was a genius. "Oh, ok, of course." I was so suprised that she will come to my home. I opened the door, and I saw what was Nora looked like. Her skin was white, and she had brown straight hair, under her her hair their was a pair of big shining brown eyes, her nose was small, and mouth was pink. She looks so beatiful, so l was a little bit shy. " Hi?" Nora said. "Oh, sorry, would you like to have some drinks? I have cola and tea." " I bring my watter." "Ok." And then, Nora said she wanted see my homework and my scores, because she wanted to know how hard the ordinary kid (such as me) study. So I showed my repord card and my homework to her. After she saw my grades, she thought I need to be harder. Because my grades are too terible. 
  After we took dinner, she watched her watch and said goodbye for me.
