One day, somebody knocked on the door.
Who was that? With the question in my mind, I opened the door.
It seemed like a person from the Tang Dynasty, which is quite famous in Chinese history. He wore Hanfu(a kind of the traditional clothes in China), with long sleeves and a black hat. He also had his long white whiskers.
It was Li Bai! The greatest poet in the whole Chinese history! I was shocked, didn't think it was real.
But I still welcomed him and took him to the living room sofa.
"So,"I asked,"Why did you came here?"
"Nothing,"He said, freely,"Just come for fun."
"And how did you came here?"I asked again.
"I don't know either."He answered.
I stopped, then said,"Mr. Li Bai, may I recite some poems for you?"
"As you wish, never mind."
And then I began:
The Moon, like white silver, shines before my bed.
It looks like frost on the ground.
Lifting my head, I look at the Moon.
Lowering my head, I'm thinking of my home town.
"Perfect!"He applaused,"You've did a great job!"
"Not really. You know what? Now children in the 21st century will first learn about your poems, and they can recite them fluently!"I answered.
"Really?"He seemed very surprised with that.
"I'm not kidding you. These are the basic skills of all the Chinese!"I laughed.
He also laughed, happily.
Then, the next day, the great poet left with proud.
"What a great experience, huh?"I asked to myself.
"Positive."
