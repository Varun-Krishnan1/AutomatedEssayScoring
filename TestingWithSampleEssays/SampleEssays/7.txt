If I knew a famous person was going to visit my home, firstly I would get in the industrial cleaners. The most famous person that I would love to visit would be the gorgeous Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is wonderful at his craft and extremely handsome. He is tall, has medium coloured hair, sprinkled with grey and is very sophisticated! I would love to discuuss his history in the theatre, on screen and his dancing. He was a dancer before he embarked on his acting career and I would ask him what prompted the move from dancing to acting.
There wouldn't be much to show him in my tiny house, but I would offer him a long glass of wine in the garden.
