In our world today plastic bags have been an important product for every human being on the planet. It is easy to produce, cost cheap, and have a variety of uses, but nothing is perfect so do plastic bags. It is an important factor causing global warming and pollution. Many supermarkets and countries around the world have banned plastic bags because of their damage to the environment. So I think our school should also apply this ban plastic bags. The first reason for this is that it could harm the school environment. School enviroment is a big part of not only the school but also the students, student won't be able to learn with a dirty and polluted environment. No one is going to promise that the students are going to reuse the plastic bag and recycle them properly. We are really familiar with the image of plastic things especially plastic bags on the side way of the street. The second reason is that the amount of plastic being produced will increase leading to pollution. Nowadays plastic bags have been around on a lot of stuff we could have seen them wrap around food that we eat every day. So if food in the cantin uses plastic bag to wrap and for the kids to carry this would cause a lot of plastic bags being produce since students in a school nowadays is not under 1000 kids per school. In conclusion, we should ban plastic bags in the school because of two reasons. The first reason is that it could harm the school environment, and the second reason is that it could make cause pollution, since that uses increase the production of plastic bags would increases.
