The other night I fell into a very deep sleep.  I know this because I didn't wake up until a lion was about to eat me alive!

Let me tell you about it ... My brother and I had decided to get on a train and go to the zoo.  It was a beautiful morning of the school holidays, and Mum and Dad had both gone to work.  Now that we are both teenagers, they let us stay home without a babysitter but we knew we were being naughty to take a train into the city.  But the day was too good to waste sitting around at home.

We had to catch a train and then a tram, but we made it by lunchtime.  After paying the entrance fee, we made our way to the lions' den because both my brother and I like the lions the most.  Usually when we have seen them they are all sleepy and not walking around, but today when we got there they were all up and about.  A crowd was gathering around their enclosure as one lion was getting quite restless and started charging towards the fence.  Cam and I pushed our way to the front just as the lion dived at the fence once more.  This time, the fence gave way and the lion was landing on top of us.  I screamed and grabbed Cam's arm as we fell to the ground under the weight of the lion.  As I looked up in horror, the lion was opening up his mouth to take us both for dinner .....

And that's when I woke up!  I have never been so relieved in all my life to wake up and find that it was still night time and I was alone in my bedroom.  It wasn't exactly a 'Sweet Dream', but we could have been a sweet main course for the runaway lion that afternoon!
