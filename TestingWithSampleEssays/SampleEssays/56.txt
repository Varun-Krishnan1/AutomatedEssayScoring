One day, when I was watching TV at home, I heard the sound of door. When I looked from the door, I was surprised, The man who outside the door was short and thin, with black suits and black shoes, he is Jackie Chen! I was so excited because he is my favourite movie star, I had seen all of his movies. At that time I couldnâ€™t control myself, so when I opened the door, I had a smile on my face. I pulled him to my house quickly and told him the feel of myself," I am so surprised that you come to my home, I'm your fan! I have seen all of your movies and they were all great!"

Then, I opened the chest in the living room, and got some things from it, they are those movies DVD, I gave them to Jackie Chen and asked could he wrote his name on them, he soon agreed. Later, I led him to my bedroom, what in it was the posters of him and some "little him". At that time he was surprised too because of all these things I have.

In the end Jackie Chen left, but I will never forget this time.
