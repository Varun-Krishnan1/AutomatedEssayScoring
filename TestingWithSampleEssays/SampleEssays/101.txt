Tom Holland would be my choice if I could invite any famous person to my house. As he walked into my house, I could smell his vehement fragrance,his glossy and oily hair covering his ears with a smooth and tanned complexion. He was able to turn a cold,dull and monotonous room into a room filled with jubilation and warmth. One of Tom Holland's endownments was his positivity which is why he could spread a simle across my face just by looking at him. Tom Holland is a well known actor as he is most famous by playing Spider-Man throughout his career. If I had a chance to speak to him, I would like to thank him for being an affable,jovial and optimistic actor. As he is also known to be a hard-worker as he is competent to take on big roles; while working strentously for our entertainment.As someone who is passionate about art, it would be a dream come true if he commented on my drawings of him playing the part of Spider-Man.
