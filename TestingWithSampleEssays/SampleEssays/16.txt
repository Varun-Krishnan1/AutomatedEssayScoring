I heard somebody knocking on the door softly. Without hesitation, I immediately opened the door and a woman stood in front of me. She was gorgeous, with black shades on and her blonde hair was tied as a bun. She also applied red lipstick very carefully as none of them was out of the border of her lip. The woman, facing in front of me was wearing a black dress, with cotton-like materials stuck onto her dress. She slipped on a pair of platform shoes which made her whole outfit spectacular.  Due to her dressing up beautifully, I assert that she would be a famous person. After all that prediction I made, I greeted her,' Salutations. You're looking fantastic today, but what brings you here?'. 'I'm just curious of how the interior of your house will look like as the outside of that is magnificent!', she replied. At first sight, I predicted that she would be a cold person but turned out that I was wrong the whole time. I let her into my house and served her a cup of tea. I let her walk wherever she wanted to and I introduced them all. Soon, she marched up the stairs first where my room was, and pleaded to chat. The mysterious woman sat on my cozy seat and started to have a glance at my room. A while later she exclaimed how lovely my room was and chatted about fashion design. Soon enough, she reminded me of a celebrity who was into fashion design and had been in several films. I questioned her if she was the one and got a reply as so,' Looks like you've struck gold today! It was a pleasure meeting you.' I was fluttered and she really was the one. She marched back to the door and her walking was the same as in the movies.
