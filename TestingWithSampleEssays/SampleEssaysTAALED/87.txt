  "Knockknock!" I immediately ran to the front door. Who is it? I thought. When I opened the door, my heart almost missed a beat, my eyes could have fallen out anytime by now. It was Soman Chainani, my favourite arthor of my favourite book - The School for Good and Evil! He looked like a film star in my eyes. His book was so famous around the world. I loved his book because it has so many clif hangers and you would never guess what happened next. It was a thrilling, majestic fantasy story. The book there was 7 books. Including The School for Good and Evil 1-6 and The Ever Never Handbook and more! I was so surprised he came. Then I, of course led him to the living room and found it perfectly dusted. I served him coffee with a gingerbread biscut and asked for his autograph. Oh how lucky I am. He asked me if I wanted to know any of thing to ask about the book he wrote. Of course I was full with questoins. I asked about how he came up with so many characters. He told me that if only you be creative, you can do it. He told me if you wnat to write a good book, you must find a quiet space, calm yourself down and let your creativity flow. For all new writers, you must not give up on yourself.
