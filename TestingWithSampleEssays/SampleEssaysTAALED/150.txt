If a famous person comes to my home, it would be a basketball star because I really admire their passion, their mentality and their sportsmanship. He would be as tall as skyscapers and be very passionate to share about his career and dreams. I should be inspired by their words and have a stronger ambition to follow my dreams. 

I would ask him about how he got so passionate about his dream and were there any obstacles during his journey. If yes, how did he overcome the obstacles and be who he is today. Also, since I am basketball fan, I would like to know more about how he communicates with his teammates on the court and ask him to give me some advise about basketball. He should be as patient as an ox. 

I would show them the Basketball collage in my room. The magnificent artwork is as vivid as a rainbow and has motivated me thoughout my whole childhood. It is made out of pictures of my idols including a lot of NBA players. I would like to show gratitude to them for making basketball such a nice sport to watch and ask him for an autograph. It would be the best time in my life! This would be a moment of a lifetime and will enhance my life and deliver happiness to the bottom of my soul. Also, I would show him my collection of pictures of him in my home as a sense of respect and admiration. 

If we have more free time, I would bring him to the basketball court and play some basketball. I would also show him around the community and reveal the hidden in the society near my home and bring him to local restuarants to learn more about our tradition and culture.

Finally, I would like to thank him for visiting me and I hope we will meet again in the future. This was a moment of a lifetime and I am very grateful for everything that happened in my life.
