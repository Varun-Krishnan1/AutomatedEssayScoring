When was the last time that you used a platic bag? Actually, the most normal answer of the question above is yesterday. It's because we live in a world which develops rapidly. However, it's necessary for people to stop using the plastic bag since it has absolutely negative effects to the environment. 

The most essential environmental issue of the plastic bag is that it decays extremely slow. Indeed, plastic bags need to take more than two years to accomplish decaying. Hence, people should use other methods, which also hurt our environment to help plastic bags to decay. For instance, scientists in my country suggest to collect plastic bags and burn them. It seems like a useful way because the speed of buring is quick, while the carbon dioxide and other chemical things produced from burning bring huge impact to the environment, which caused the air of my country becomes not as fresh as before.

In addition, more demands for this kind of bag accelerate unpleasant influences of the plastic bag. I believe that all of you have heard about the news that shows the accumlation of plastic bags everywhere, especially in the ocean.

Due to lots of disadvantages of the plastic bag, it's important for us to ban the plastic bag and find other bags to replace it. There are two advisable ways that we can follow to protect our world. Firstly, we can use some environmental friendly bags which are made by wood or other natural materials. Secondly, we can purchase one plastic bag, and always use it until it breaks. In conclusion, let's stop using plastic bags in order to help our environment
