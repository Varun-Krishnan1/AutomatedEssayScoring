My favourite superhero is Wonder Woman. Flowing long black hair, serene face, bright sparkling eyes, magnificent armor and a shining sword -- when people speak of Wonder  Woman, the image of her comes to mind immediately. I still remember I first saw this character on TV. I was pleasantly surprised as the superhero characters were mostly males. Once I had my eyes on her, my eyes were completely glued to the screen as Wonder Woman's stunning looks and her astonishing combat skills captured all of my attention. Wonder Woman possesses inhuman strength, agility, and combat skills, being able to leap really high and sprint for long distances without tiring. I admire Wonder Woman because she has a direct, straight-forward, honest personality: she always says the truth and does not seem to be much exposed to the evils of the world, being innocent and pure even after experiencing a lot. She is kind and selfless, willing to sacrifice herself to save humans. This superhero also means much to me because it is a symbol of the strength of feminity. She is proof that girls can be heroes too and accomplish great things, giving me courage to stand up for myself in daily life. When I encounter troubles in daily life, I always think :  " Wonder Woman would never give up and fight till the end despite difficulties; I must not give up also!" I look up to Wonder Woman as an ideal example and I admire her for all her amazing qualities. I have much to learn from her and she is definitely my favourite superhero!
