My favorite season is summer not winter. Because during summer, you can eat ice cream when it's hot without getting brain freeze easily. when we get brain freeze our brain just hurts a lot and it just hurts to eat so if you want an exuse to eat ice cream.  However during winter you get to eat hot stuff and hot drinks like hot chocolate, hot pot. etc. But summer is perfect for swimming because, the water might be cold and when it is summer the sun is shining on you so intensly that you will easily get sunburned. During winter most of the time you get a good break from work and can go traveling. You could go to a hot spring for a relaxing time or you could receive christmas gifts during winter! But personaly my favorite thing about summer is that I get a one month and two week break from school and can go almost anywhere and visit my friends, I  can even go on a beach with lemonade and relax on a soothing floating mat. And that is why summer is my prefered season over winter.
