The strangest animal I have ever seen is anglerfish.Anglerfish lives in deep ocean,maybe they live in the mariana trench.I think it is the strangest animal I've ever seen because it looks pretty ugly.Some people even call it a oldman-like fish.The whole body is cover of the dark color,So it can't be find in such a dark area in the buttom of the sea.It has a strange hunting skill too.Every anglerfish has a glowing stuff on its head in the front of the body.The tiny glowing stuff will become quite shiny in the darkness.So this stuff will attracts some small fish and they will probably swim towards the glowing stuff of the anglerfish.Then those small fish will be eaten by the anglerfish.Human beings sometimes eat anglerfish as a food.When hunting these fish. Because of these kind of fish live in the deep and high-pressure area.So when they go up, their eyeballs will pop out.It's kinda gross and strange.So tihs is the strangest animal I've ever seen.
