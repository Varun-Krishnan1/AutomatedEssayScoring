Everybody has got a superhero, and so do I...

Through electronics, people admire superheroes for saving villages, defeating villains, and being powerful but warmhearted. Heroes and normal citizens would be stereotyped in a variety of ways, creating a distant difference between one another. Yet, as a famous saying: "not every superhero wear capes", this has altered my biased perspective about heroes entirely. 

She, my life-long role model, has been with me throughout my childhood till now, every single painful situation, like a keen blade stabbing my body murderously with no mercy, and every uplifting moment. With every tear streaming down my eyes, like a river casually flowing down, and each pleasant smile that has been plastered up against my face, she has always been around, carefully advising considerable comments. Also, every single word she peacefully uttered is deeply cherished and remembered wholeheartedly in my hopeless soul.

She saved my life, my hero...
