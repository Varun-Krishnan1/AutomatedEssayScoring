If a famous person came to my house then I imagine them to be Bts Jimin. He is really handsome and kind towards everyone he sees. He is Korean and right now he has brown hair with some tattoos on him. Jimin is also the shortest out of Bts but is an amazing dancer. His nicknames are ChimChim, Mochi and Diminie. Jimin is part of BTS, one of the world's biggest boy bands, with their fans named Bts. Bts started getting more attention in 2017, which is when fans started noticing Jimin. He was seen as an exceptional dancer among the members of BTS and kpop in general. People praised him for having smooth and elegant movements. Not only this but he is hilarious and knows how to keep people entertained. Jimin has phenomenal visuals and talent. His voice has captured many fans as they describe it as heavenly. The first thing I would say to Jimin is how much he has impacted my life, as Bts's main goal in their music is to make people themselves. Jimin has been my role model for years and I just want him to know that people do care about him as he has low self-esteem and thinks of himself as lowly. I would also tell him that there are millions of people who are willing to listen to his troubles as he doesn't have people whom he can always rely on to talk to. I would mainly just talk about how great he is and how he has helped so many people love themselves again.  I would show them lyrics where I have annotated them so he knows that his songs truly do have an impact on us. I would also show him my plants as he really enjoys nature.
