Every person has their favorite cecebrity, it is always an imagination for them to meet their favorite celebrity. Today, I'll imagine that if a famous person really comes to mycelebri house, what will happen?
One day, Steven Curry- a famous NBA basketball player came to my house bacause of my invitation. When I was looking at him, I was quite shocked that he didn't show himself off on the street, he just wore a sweather with a cap. I knew that Steven Curry is a famous player in NBA that plays for the warriors, and he had just won a FMVP months ago. He started playing basketball in NBA about 10 years ago.
When I got home, I asked them about his basketball life at the first time. I asked him how could he play basketball so well, and he said that practise makes perfect and he enjoyed playing basketball since a young age so the enthusiasm made him to play it. After asking questions, Istarted showing him things in my home. The showing process began with the food. Chinese dumplings were eaten, followed by the desserts. Next, I started showing him traditional paintings in my home. We both had a great day with each other.
In the evening, after a wonderful day, I went to the airport to say goodbye to my favorite celebrity- Steven Curry. So, that's my imagination for meeting a famous person. Does it sounds
