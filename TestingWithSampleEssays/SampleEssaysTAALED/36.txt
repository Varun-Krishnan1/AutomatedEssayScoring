Dear Anna,


How are you doing Anna? I want to tell you about my dream last night. There was a giant monster that come into my house and wanted to eat my family. My family needs to run away to hide from it. It was so creepy I wanted to cry.
But I can't if I cry the monster will know. I wanted to punch his face but I'm too small. Then I ate lots of food then I turn into a giant kid that can punch him. I punch in the face I just help my family!
When I  woke up I was so excited to tell my friend and my family.

Thanks for reading my story.

Your best friend,

Xuka
