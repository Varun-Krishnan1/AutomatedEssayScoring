  A person knocked on my door. Slowly, I opened the entrance. A man with black, curly hair stepped forward, his big eyes stared into mine,  and his skinny hands reached forward -- Hanyu Yuzuru! He is the champion of many Olympic games, and the gold medals reflect rays of sunlight that pierced my eyes. "Hello! I never thought you would come! My mom made some cookies. Quick, come inside." I said happily as he stepped into my house. He's famous for his ice skating skills. He's also great at studying, and he continuously calculates the time or angle that is best for landing and how to improve his skills. My mom always says that my sister and I should learn from him -- be determined just like he always wants to jump a 4A on the Olympics ( jumping and spinning four and a half time, no one had ever tried this before.) That is why I'm be so excited to meet him. I also asked him how to be so determined on a specific thing and why he chose to ice skate in the first place. After all these questions, I showed him our house. First, my sister's room, especially the little doll she made of Hanyu. Then, he followed me to the garage, where a wooden structure of him sits. He's pleased to see these things and claims we are all good at crafting. When it was time to leave, we said goodbye and waved at him as his shadow slowly disappeared in the distance......
