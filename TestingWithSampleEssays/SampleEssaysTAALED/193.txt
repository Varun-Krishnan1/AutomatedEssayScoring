One day my fan Roger Federer comes to my home. He is so Hadsome and he teach me about tennis. Roger Federer is the king of tennis.I Ask him about how to play tennis in the best way? He said use your own tactics and fear to no one, Respect everyone. I like Roger Federer so much because he plays tennis so well and no one can beats him. I also ask him about how many first place he got in his live? But now Roger Federer is retired. He is already 41 year old. And I will show him the tennis certificate I have got for tennis. And I will show him the racket I'm use now, it is the same racket I have as federer. I will ask why you play tennis and why you play tennis is it fun? I my own mind tennis is very fun!
