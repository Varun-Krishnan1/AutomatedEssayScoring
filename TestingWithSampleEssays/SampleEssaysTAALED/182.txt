Nowadays , people love shooping so much they just can't help doing it,while shopping,people often wastes a lot of plastic bags , and that caused a lot of harm to the environment.
Because of that , some supermarkets in number of countries have banned plastic bags.I think our school shall ban plastic bags for the environment as well.
There are a few reasons of why we shall ban plastic bags.First,plastic bags cannot be reused.When they are used one or two times , most of the people will choose to throw them away,and get a new one,that produces a large amount of trash that will cause harm to the environment.Its not environmentally friendly.Second , some of the careless students may throw them on the corridor or in the classrooms.Plastic bags are quite slippery , the plastic bags on the walkway may trip someone or cause an accident.We don't want that to happen and cause harm to students or teachers.At last , plastic bags are hard to dissolve , if it was disposed into the nature,it will take hundreds of years to dissolve.If a large amount of plastic bags are disposed,it may even affect the food chain,at last,humans will pay for what they have done.
Somebody may asked,'What can we use to replace plastic bags?'The best solution is for students or teachers to bring their own bags to school.The other solution is to replace plastic bags with paper bags . Plastic bags cannot be reused as well as paper bags,but paper bags are easier to dissolve and its harmless for most of the animals.Its not the perfect solution but I think it will cause less harm to humanbeings and the environment.
I hope our school and students can take action after reading my article,for the sake of the environment and most importantly,for ourselves.
