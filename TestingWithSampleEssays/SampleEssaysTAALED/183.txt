    One day I was at home, reading my favorite book,when all these things happendI was visited by my idol one of the most famous people in Chinathe presidentXi Jingping
    I was so surprised that I was completely shocked by his coming.At last , I tried my best to calm down and speak to him.I often saw our president on television, but it is not easy to tell his look when you actually see him.He is not tall, but it's easy to see his confidence in his eyes.Also, he wears suit,looks like a experienced teacher.But I know he truly changed the fate of China, so does formal presidents.That's why he is famous:he thinks of his people and is easy to go along with.
    I asked:"So, why do you come here.Why not the rich men, or the known scientists?"He told me that he often visits people like this, he'll ask them about daily life and advice for the government.I told him everything I know.He was glad and shake my hands.I felt so lucky!
    When Xi is leaving, he suddenly asked:"What are you reanding, may I know?"I showed him the book Sophie's World.It is a famous book about life.I also showed him my bookshelf, with all kinds of books on it.He told me to read more and stay focus at school, in order to make a big difference to the society when I grow up.
    After a long time, I still cannot calm my emotions down.It is so lucky and awsome to have this unforgettable experience!
