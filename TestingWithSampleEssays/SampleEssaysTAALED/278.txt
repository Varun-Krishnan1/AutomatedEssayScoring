   When i was a child, my parents always say that i have a very bitter uncle,  however, i never seen him in the past. One day afternoon, i came back from school as usual. My sister is so exercited, i feel uncertain but i didn't ask for her, cause she said it's a secret.
   Then, i follow my sister and go back to my bedroom quickly, i'm expect for the surprise. When i open the door, i seen a men who i never seen but i know a lot for him, that' s my uncle. In my impression, mu uncle is a writers, everyone know the book he write, and the most famous one is talk about the romantic for the machine and human. This new and orignial novel attract many girls become his fans and i' m one of them. You cant imagine how excited i was.

He sit on my chair and reading my own novel which i give him , I didn't talk anything cause i'm so nervous. i never show others my no No more than 10 minutes uncle says it's a nice subject. I'm happy and a little shame for it. And for the rest of the time, he give me some suggest and sustain my to wirte more.  He personally guided me next to me.
