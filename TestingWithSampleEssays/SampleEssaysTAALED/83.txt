  Chocolate. A sweet created with coco and sugar. Although it might seem like nothing more that a simple sweet that everyone loves, it can a lot of people that don't have enough income to even support themselves. Here are a few reasons why i should be the winner.
  Firstly, I will give out as much chocolate i can to anyone who might need it. A lot of people who don't have a sufficient income might not be able to feed themselves or their families. I can help them by giving the chocolate out in different types of food. You might be a bit confused but hear me out. I can turn the chocolate into different food such as spliting the chocolate into small pieces and mixing them with dough, creating chocolate crackers. I can also turn the chocolate into chocolate drinks by melting the chocolate and adding a bit of water in order to compensate the sweetness. All of the ideas above are treated with maximum hygiene. That will help a lot of people as they can have food to eat and have a lower chance of starving and getting sick.
  Secondly, it could help schools by providing the teachers with chocolate snacks instead of needing the teacher to buy it themselves. As all of you know, there are a lot of teachers out there who love to treat students with snacks if they score well in tests or do good in class. The teachers would need to buy the snacks themselves as the school isn't providing them with snacks to gift students. But if the chocolate were in my hands, i would give a plenty amount of chocolate to any teachers who would want to give their students treats if they wanted to. It can also reduce the financial stress of teachers who have lower income that want to give students a treat or two.
  That is about it for why i should be the winner. There are alot of positive things that could happen if i were the winner. And I really hope that I can be the winner as I had always wanted to help people who are in need. Thank you!
