My favourite superhero is Spiderman. Spiderman before he put his suit on is just and average school boy. He likes a girl at his school which is also his classmate and he also frequently get bullied by a guy named Flash Thompson. When his whole class go to a unnamed research insitute and see many different types of spiders, he took his chance and asked his crush can he take a picture and she said yes. While taking the picture he got bitten by a spider which changes his DNA and make him have the power of super human strength, agility, endurance, the ability to shoot webs and the ability to climb on walls and other surfaces. After he figure out that he has powers, he made himself a suit that is used to hide his identity. The suit is red with blue on the leg, forearm and has black webs on it. The suit also has two eyes for him to look through which look like a hemisphere. There are many different types of Spiderman movies such as Spiderman No Way Home, Spiderman Homecoming. The charactor is also acted by many actor such as Toby Maguire, Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield. I admire this superhero because it is the superhero that I have watched the most when I was young and the Spiderman movies sometimes also show friendship. In conclusion I like Spiderman because I think he is cool, friendly and helpful.
