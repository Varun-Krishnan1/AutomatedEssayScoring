I come home after class, really tired. However, I discover my mom is wearing a strange facial expression and she says," someone is coming to our house. You will scream when you see!" 
Opening the door with some confusement and some excitement, I see a very familiar shadow, tall and thin. "No way... Are you...Hanyu Yuzuru?" The person turns around, which makes me scream loudly,"God! I cannot believe my eyes!"
Hanyu Yuzuru is one of the most famous and legendary ice skater around the world, with countless honors and records throughout his life as an athlete. He became exdroadinarily well-known after the Beijing Winter Olympic Game. His appearence, proffesional skills and the attitude toward ice skating and everyone around him gained him a huge population of fans in different countries.
Hanyu smiles at me. I run in front of him, saying," I am a fan of you for many years. I have so many things I want to tell you, but...but I cannot calm my mind. First of all, congradualations to you for becoming a professional ice skating perfomer and please continue to skate for yourself and the expectations of fans. Umm...I don't know what I want to say. Here, please allow me to show my room to you!"  Looking at him closely, I discover that he is much more skinny andeven taller comparing to his photos. He can even be compared as a chopstick, wearing a normal T-shirt.
I lead him into my room and says, " I bought and created a lot of things related to you. Here is a photobook from Japan, some photos I printed out, your biography, and look! This is a picture I drew that included all the performances you presented through the 20 years. That costs a lot of my effort!" 
I show him a lot things and after dinner, he leaves, giving me a signature of him and an inspiration always remeber
