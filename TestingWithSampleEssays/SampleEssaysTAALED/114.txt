Summer weather is perfect for sports at the beach and swimming. The weather is very hot and very tropical, at the beaches you can eat hotdogs at the stands and drink fresh coconut water from the coconut tree at the beach. I think the summer sports that is play the most is beach volleyball or you can just chill in the warm weather under the shed. Winter weather is perfect for winter sports such as sking and you may like to hike some mountains.The weather is very cold and polar, at some hills you can play with the snow. You can also enjoy the marvelous, magnificent view from this weather. In my opionion, summer weather is my favourite because of it temperature and their is alot of activities that you can do in this weather, not like in the winter you can't do much. I don't like winter because sometime it is too cold and often people will get sick or fever.
