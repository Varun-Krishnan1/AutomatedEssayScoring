One of my Favourite Influencer of all time is Jennie from Blackpink. I'm obsessed with her style to her looks in each and every event she has been. She is a well known kpop artists under Yg entertainment. Though she is a korean artist her music has spread worldwide an has infleunce many people across the world to persue their passion. Blackpink is consist of 4 members, Jennie is the main rapper of the band . Each member has their own style but I find that Jennie matches my style the most. She is quite an introvert just like me and has healthy and gorgeous skin. If she were to come to my house I would show her my pet dog because we both adore dogs and puppies. The other things i'll show her are my essentials such as my favorite pillow, something I cant live without or something I had great memories with. I would also tell her how exited I am to meet her faced to faced and how nervous and overwhelmed I am that she had visited my home and personal space. On the other hand I would tell her my favourite memories with Blackpink such as the concert I've went in 2019 or when me and my friends dance to her songs almost everyday. Blackpink make such fun songs and shows both masculant and feminine side of woman. It would be a great and memorable gem in my life that i'll try to remember for the rest of my life.
