There are a lot of superheros in books or movies, and who is my superhero? My favourite superhero is Wolverine. This essay will look at my superhero and why I like him.
Wolverine is a human adult with hair tilt up on each side. His superpower can stretch out paws from his hand, heal himself very fast, and he is also very strong. Sometimes his healing time can be faster than the time he's getting hurt. Thats why he's so strong in the movie X-man.
I like Wolverine the best is because he never gives up his team mate. He has the leader spirit and mostly he's handsome. I suppose Wolverine is difinitely the optimal superhero to exist.
