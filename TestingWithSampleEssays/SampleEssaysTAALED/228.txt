 if i would want a famous person to come to my house, Stephan marbury is no doubt my answer.His most visible facial figure is that his bald head and his 190 height. His height isn't supurb as a man playing in the nba but still quite tall. HIs work ethic and his determination are why i want to invite him to my house.His chilhood was quite bad, born into a poverity-stricken family and he knew that by only playing in the nba could sustain himself and the family. He was the fourth pick in the 1996 draft which was impressive since that year, enumerable amounts of talented players went to the draft. That's why i admire him, the amount of hard work he had put in and the desirably result he got but not to forgot his basketball skills. I would likely show him my jersey of him since i'm a fan but also i would say words of thankfulness as he is my role model and he inspired me in many ways.
