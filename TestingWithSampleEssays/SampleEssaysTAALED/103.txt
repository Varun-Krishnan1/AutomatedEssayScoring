The dream was the clown is chasing me. at start it was fun with the clown and suddenly the clown just starting to laugh in a evil way and he start to pull out a knife. i was running and the clown was chasing me. i hide into a bush then suddenly the clown appear behind me i was so scared that i run away. The clown is still smiling and laugh then i saw a man that part i was happy but when i was near him the man just vanish away. That part i was desperate but i was still running away. I saw a mall with lot of people. I run to the mall then boom it was vanish and turn into the clown that part i was so desperate that i stop running and let the clown come near me but when the clown was near me and i close my i with tears I WAKE UP. When i wake up i was so terrify that went out of bed immedately then i realize it just a dream. that day at the dinner i told every thing to my parent and my parent was laughing because i was scared that i jump of bed.
