Plastic bags should be banned at our school
Nowadays,more and more supermarkets in Australia begin to ban plastic bags.They use paper bags that can be recycled to replace the plastic bags.As we are Australian students ,I think our school should also stop using the plastic bags ,because those bags are harmful to the environment and not as strong as our own clothe bag.
Firstly,plastic bags have a bad effort on the environment.Sea pollution is very seiourly now,one of the reasons that cause sea pollution is plastic bags.We use them and throw them into the rubbish bin,howvever,it is very hard for goverment to deal with those white rubbish.The governments of some countries chose to leave them in the sea., so sea pollution happened.Some goverments burn the plastic bags in order to clean them quickly.It's even worse to the enviroment,the black smoke that is proudced by the burning plastic bags can pollute the air.If we don't stop such action ,we may can't breathe after ten years.
Secondly,plastic bags are not as strong as our own clothe bags.Bring your own bags can not only save some money but also prevent some  embarress things happen.For example,we buy a plastic whitch is not very strong,
IN colustion,I think plastic bags should be banned at our school.
