The strangest animal I have seen is a cheetah. It has yellow fur with black spots. It's small eyes and sharp teeth makes it look unfriendly.
Most cheetahs live in the plains or in zoos. The first time I have seen a cheetah was in an animal documentary. I am very scared of cheetahs since they have sharp teeth and they are very fast.In the animal documentarys, they often catch animals in the blink of an eye, and eat them. The scene is quite frighteneing for me. Therefore, I think a cheetahs is a dangerous creature.
Despite its threatening looks, a cheetah can only chirp like a bird! When I first saw cheetahs, I thought they will roar loudly like lions. I was very surprised when I heard their sound at first.
Therefore, a cheetah is definitly the strangst animal I have ever seen. I will never judge a book by its cover again!
