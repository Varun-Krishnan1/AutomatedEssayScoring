Here he comes! Swinging through the city! From an ordinary human, to a superhero that saved millions of lives, just in one night! The films about him showed how powerful he was as a sueprhero, but also his strength thoughout his childhood which was filled with loss. My favourite superhero is SpiderMan! SpiderMan, also known as Peter Parker, is a young boy that has arachnid like powers, he wears a red and blue creepy yet cool suit and has self-designed web shooters to catch and criminal in sight. He also mastered a special skill called "Spider Sense", it warns him of  upcoming danger. As stealthy as a cheetah, as sneaky as a thief, he always manages to save humanity. 

After his beloved Uncle Ben died to a burglar, grief-stricken Peter was determined to protect his city, and thoughout his missions, he learnt a indispensable lesson, "With great power come great responsibility". I adore Spiderman because it is very relatable since he goes through somethingthat basically everyone has to go through. When he has power, he forgets about family and his responsibility and he also has problems with relationships and guilt. I'm sure that's the case for most teenagers at his age. Also, another reason why I adore spiderman so much is because of his superhuman powers, clinging to walls like bats, swinging to places like monkies, and using webs to catch "prey" like spiders. 

SpiderMan is such an iconic, intelligent and heroic superhero. He is in everyone's childhood memories, and I'm sure everyone would wish to have his powers to save the world!
