dear everyone,
my name is Phuong Mai and i extremely want to cancle a rule that use a plastic bags for packing things in general. First reason is it might make the earth become pollution, i guese someone will ask why and how,. So it basicly that example, in the ocen, have a lot of people throw the waste into the ocen and they just think basicly that it will be normal because it make you feel more convenience instead of go around to clean the trash. But opposite with that, throw the wast into the ocean it extremely harmful. Sometime the sea animal might eat that and they will die because of choking. Another reason is it might cannot recycle so the smell of it will spread out everywhere. So the earth will become pollution, and it call airpollution. When the air become too much pollution, it will make the inhabitants get disease and they might be die .But in this one,we have a solution is appeal to everyone to pick up trash. However, it will be more harmless but it didn't mean that the air will become clean and have no pollution. So the best way that we need to avoid using plastic bags as much as possible. That is all my opinion so i hope that you guys can think about it and cancle this rule.
