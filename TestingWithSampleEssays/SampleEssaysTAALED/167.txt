Nowdays, the recycling process of plastic became a problem to human. So people had a heated debate about whether plastic bags should be banned. In my opinion, plastic bags should not be sold and students should not to use it anytime anywhere. 

Firstly, plastic bags are harmful to the environment. Plastic is a material that not human but also nature can not recycle. If people burn the plastic garbages, the gases that they made can kill lots of people all over the world. Also, these litter will pollute soil if human put them under ground. For example, the scientists went to the north face of Earth to burn plastics to find the solution of the plastic problem. however, we had not find the best way to deal with it. So, plastic bags are harmful to the environment and Earth.

Moreover, using plastic bags form a bad habit to people. Everyone should be prepared before they want to do something. However, people will not prepare a bag before shopping if the supermarkets provide plastic bags, that will lead to a bad atmosphere of the society. 

Lastly, using plastic bags may lead to many problems even wars between countries. For example, Japan had put the polluted water to the ocean and many countries are angry with Japan's action. That is because that Japan polluted the Earth. As a result, using plastic bags may be a problem between countries. 

So, we should not using plastic bags angmore so that our Earth will be more pretty.
