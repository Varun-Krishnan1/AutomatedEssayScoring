In recent years, some supermarkets in a number of countries have banned plastic bags as an action to help the environment. Plastic bags sometimes are not neccesary, such as putting enclosed food in plastic bags. This increases the number of plastic bags which can be avoided, and plastic bags cause many enironmental problems. 

First of all, plastic bags take centries to be natrually degrade, which means they take ages to be dissolved by the environment. With the pace of our uses, most of the landfills will be full in under a decade, which leads to more landfills and more unuseable spaces. Other rubbish treatment is to burn them, but burning plastic produces greenhouse gas, making the serious global warming more serious. 

Secondly, not all people are well behaving that they just throw rubbish on the street or into the ocean. If they throw plastic bags on the, the area starts to get dirty, and this will increase the workload of cleaners. If they throw into the ocean, marin lifes may treat plastic bags as food, and they may eat them and causes diseaes due to their stomach full of plastic bags. They may also get trapped in plastic bags, which greatly affect their daily life.

Therefore, I believe that plastic bags should be banned at our school to help the enivronment. Plastic bags are not essential as there are lots of alternative, for example, frabic bags, backpack, or even our hands. If students have a habit of not using plastic bags, this will lower the number of plastic bags in the world by a tiny fraction. Although it doesn't seem a lot, we should still do our best to keep our mother nature healthy, for us and the next generations.
