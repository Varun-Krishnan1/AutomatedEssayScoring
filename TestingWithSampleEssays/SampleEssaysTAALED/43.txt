I am not a superhero fans.But when i was small,i like Spider-Man the most although i never seen superhero before.First,Spider-Man is always in red and blue tight costume to make sure he could easily  to almost any movement by the wearing.And he is wearing a mask in red full owith spider web texture.Spider-Man has some special skils such as he has superhuman strength and spped.Also,he can cing to nearly any surface by his hands and feet,and he can warns him of danger.After that,his most famous skill was shoot specially formulated spider silk with a spider web launcher.At last, i think the reason that i like Spider-Man among many other superheros is because i think his special skills were so cool to help people.Other than this,the most important is i remember that Spider-Man was still having school but sometimes he went to save people and i thought he was very kind.
