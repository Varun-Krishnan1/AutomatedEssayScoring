To Amy:
      Yesterday I thought about a really interesting dream . It is about my friends , alien and me . Once the aliens enter earth in 2434 , we went to protect our home so we went out and build a secret building in a high technolay way which made the building really strong , but  the aliens got higher technolag than we got . So we fight together , I am the captain of our ship and I deceieded to put our attention on the big boss on the huge alien ship . A bad thing happend is that we don't got enough fire to shot and the alien were out of control . So I wonder if I could go inside the alien ship and kill the alien boss. I pretend that I am an alien in the ship so they could't find me . At last, I finally killed the boss alien and the Earth is back to peace.
