In recent years, some supermarkets across the world have banned plastic bags, and I belive our school community should follow in their footsteps. Countless research over the years has proven that pollution is one the main driving factors of climate change and plastic is one of the main contributors. Sure, plastic bags are quick and convient to use, but its impact on their enviorment is deadly; plastic takes decades, if not centuries to naturally dispose of. When we are still continuing to use plastic bags even though we are aware of the harm it does to our enviorment, we are showing that we do not care for our planet. Climate change may seem like to big of a problem for us students to tackle, but to help combat climate change, we must all do our part, no matter how small and insignificant it may seem. Banning the usage of plastic bags in our school may seem like a small step, but it is vital to slow the effects of climate change. To those wondering what we would use instead of plastic bags, do not worry, I have a solution in mind. Instead of using single-use platic bags, we could use totebags. Tote bags are not only stylish, and cheap, it is most importantly good for the enviorment since it can be reused. While banning platic bags may seem like an unnessecary change to some, climate change is too big of an issue for us to not take action immediately.
