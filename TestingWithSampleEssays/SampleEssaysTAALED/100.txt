When I was a child, I always imagine that Hellen Keller someday came to my house.  Helen Keller is deaf and bilnd , she is a best selling author and a famous world traveler. Hellen Keller lost her sight and hearing when she was 2 years old by a big fever. Her best selling books are The World I Live in and Midstream. I want to tell Hellen Keller that you might not be very luckey but she is smart brave and have a good passion in learning. Even when your a deaf and blind, you didnt gave up  and published many books which was still famous today. in some point you are lucky.
I want to show her my house my writting them down and her teacher, Ms Sullivan to "translate" it. becasue she can't see and hear so i need to describe it to her. In 21 centry there is already ways to help deaf and blind to hear and see things again. if Hellen Keller is still alive , she might have a change to see my house and see the world again. Hellen Keller is not lucky but brave smart and she's a lengend !
