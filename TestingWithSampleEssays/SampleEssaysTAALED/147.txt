Dear Piper Maclane ,
Hi piper ! I'm Lucy - your old kindergarden friend, do you remember me ? Yesterday, i had a good dream,so I'm going to tell you about it. It's really funny! I dream that Lunas , Helios me and the other friends are playing hide and seek. We want to go upstair so we step on the escalator that has a warning sign. Actually that's what Lunas probbally do. To stop her, Helios and I run onto the escalator's stairs. But, right when we step on the first stair of the escalator, it take us to the another world. At the time we land on it , we are very scared. We saw a fire dragon, a witch and many other fiction things. We scream very loud. I think I can't tell you the end because i woke up after that. What's your  dream ?  Tell me !
Love, Lucy
