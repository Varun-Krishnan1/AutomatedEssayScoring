Dear Friend,

Did you know once, I have a very interesting dream about I am the only person left in the world. So what I did was, eat everything in the store and I can even get anything I want. Even though, I can have anything I want, I was pretty lonely I have no friends to played with no one to care for you, no one to cooked for you it is just really lonely there. I can only stay where I was because there was no one to drive for me so I couldn't travel anywhere.

After I woke up from that dream, everyone think that being the only person in the world was fun but it is actually really boring. Still being with your family and friends was still much more fun. Like now I am talking to you if you were all by yourself there will be no one to talked and played with. So you should spend time with them more so they don't felt lonely.
