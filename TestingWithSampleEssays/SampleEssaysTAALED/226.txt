  Today some famous people came to my house. I'm so excited to see them! They all look gorgeous and they're all wearing fancy clothes. My dad whispers to me and said they're singers and writers so I guess the are famous because of there job. And as soon as they get in we gave them brand new slippers to wear and they start looking around our house and my job is to take them around and show them some cool things in our house.
   First I took them to our lounge room and I introduced them our antiques and told them the history of it they thought it was very unique and interesting they liked it very much. Next I showed them some paintings that I drew and why I wanted to draw this picture and my thoughts when I was drawing it and I shared so they thought I was really tallented and my parents will be really proud of me. They also thought I might be a famous artist one day. After that I showed them our backyard.We have a big swimming pool and lots of beautiful plants in it there's also a little BBQ lounging area. We sat there and chated and relaxed for a while and we smelled the fresh air and the flowers.I t was really a great time and opertunity to talk with famous people I was tired but happy.
