I want to be a winner because i opened a dessert shop ,i'm a start-up entrepreneur,a year's free chocolate is very helpful to my business ,it can reduce my expenses.
I plan to use some of these chocolates in my dessert shop for dessert ,and take some chocolate to develop new products,i still planing every saturday i brought some chocolate and other desserts,visit the children in the welfare home,play with them.
When my dessert business stabilizes,i will use the money made from chocolate to help some poor children,special relief for patients with hypoglycemia,or help some patients with depression,i think eating dessert can make them less sad.
That's all my plan,i hope to do my best to help more people
