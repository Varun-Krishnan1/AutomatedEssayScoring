     One sunday afternoon, Albert Einstein comes into my home. He is famous for his studies on theoratical physics. He is just like any old neighbour, kind and warm, filled with wisdom. He has dense, grey hair that could be compared to an alpine tree covered with a moderately thick layer of snow in winter. He also has a grey mustache spreading across his face. Looking down, I see him wearing a green sweater and a long pair of grey pants that just fits him. He is also wearing a pair of light-brown shoes which were polished. I offer him a seat and pour him a cup of tea, as I ask him, "Mr. Einstein, can you explain me the physics behind a white hole? Since it repels things, wouldn't it be a positive curve in the fabric of space and time?"
After having a (preferrably lengthy) discussion about theoratical physics, I show him works of other theoratical physicians, to showcase how far the subject he has dedicated his whole life to has gone.
     In the end, I bid farewell to him, as he leaves my home through the front door.
