  Have you ever seen some strange animal? If yes, which one do you think is the strangest? For me, the strangest animal I have seen is octopus. They live in the sea and they look totally different from most of the marine species. The most obvious example is that they have eight legs that full of suckers. Also, their body are able to pass through a tiny seam and the minimum size of the seam depends on how big their mouth is. It is because their hole body are soft and flexible except their mouth. 
  The reason why I think octopus is the strangest animal I have ever seen is that they are very intelligent. Their IQ are as same as a little child which is very top in animalia. Moreover, they are very good at escape. For example, if they are caught by the fishermen, they will keep on looking for a gap that allow them to escape. Last but not least, they have a talent for imitating others' action. There is a experiment that talks about this ability. In the experiment, the octopus will be blocked in a jar. Then a man show it how to open the jar in another room. After a while, that octopus opened the jar in a same way as the man's did. This shows that they have tha ability on imitating others' action.
  Octopus is really an interesting and intelligent animal and thats the reason why I think it is the stangerest animal I have ever seen.
