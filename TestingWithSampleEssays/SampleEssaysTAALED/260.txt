  Plastic bags are known and used worldwide for their convenience and versatility. They are easily stored, used, produced, and are non-toxic to use on most occasions. Despite their countless advantages, they also bring long-term dangers to the world, such as air pollution, sea pollution, land pollution. I strongly believe that their disadvantages vehemently outweigh their advantages and that we should take action to reduce the use of plastic bags in our school.

  First and foremost, plastic bags contributes to the worsening of air pollution when being produced in large scale productions. In order to produce plastic bags, factories undergo different processes, and one of the major processes is heating. However, heating releases a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, which is the cause of global warming. Moreover, the different processes might produce toxic gases, which are harmful to society and animals.

  When plastic bags enter the sea, it leads to sea pollution. We odten see cases of sea creatures accidentally eating these plastic bags. However, they can not digest it or the chemicals in the plastic bag might be toxic for them, causing numerous deaths of the sea creatures and an imbalance in the ecosystem.

  Thirdly, plastic bags contains chemicals that are extremely hard to decompose. They do not decompose even after hundreds of years. This phenomenon adds up to landfill pollution, and affects the world long-term.

  By reducing the use of plastic bags, we can help change the world for the better. It decreases the rate of pollution and climate change worsening and provides a clean, safer, more hygenic earth for the future generations. Hence, we as students, should take action and not use plastic bags at school anymore.
