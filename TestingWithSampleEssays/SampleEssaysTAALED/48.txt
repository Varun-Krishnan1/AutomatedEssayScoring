My favorite superhero is Spider-man. His name is Peter Parker. He has a speed beyond normal. He's a student, but then he was bitten by a spider and got superpower. He could swing above the city on a thread. His uncle told him that with great power comes to great responsibility. So he began to punish the criminals. Crime rates dropped dramatically. There are some people who, when they get their powers, do bad things and do whatever they want. But Peter Parker did the right thing, fighting against crime. That's what attracted me most.
