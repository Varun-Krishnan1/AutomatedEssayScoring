  Paganini came to my house yesterday ,he has very long hair and a pair of beautiful eyes .When i met him i asked him how did you become the god of violin and how you became famous,he said it  because i was a genius and my violin skiils is the best people in the word .
  Then i tookmhim into my room and showed him my vilolin,when he saw it ,he said it was a good violin but it left a lot to be desired ,then he slowly disapperaed....
