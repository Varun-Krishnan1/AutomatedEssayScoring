In these recent years, shops snd supermarkets in the country have stopped using plastic bags, I wrote this article to persuade the students in our school to stop using plastic bags as well, down here are some reasons why plastic bags should be stopped using.

Firstly, plastic bags are single used, people only use it once and throw it away. Thrown away plastic bags can pollute the environment includind our land and water. Next, because they're so lightweight, plastic bags can travel long distances by wind and water. After that sea creatures think the plastics bags are food and then eat them, eventually they will choke and starve to death. As these problems occur, people have volunteered to pick up trash in many polluted places including beaches, forests, and in cities also.

Another reason is that plastic bags take a long time to decompose, they make take up thousands of years to decompose completely. Using plastic bags are dangerous for our health too, this is because animals and sea creatures that ate the trash( including plasic bags) end up being our food.

We don't have to stop using them completely, just don't use it one time. Many people reuse plastic bags and some also recycles them into environment-friendly products. I hope the school can stop using plastic bags so we can have a cleaner planet.
