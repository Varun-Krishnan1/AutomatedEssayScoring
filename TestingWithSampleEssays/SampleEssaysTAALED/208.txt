Gigi is a famous singer in Hong Kong. She has a long hair and big eyes. She is famous because she won a singing competition and her voice is like angel. 

I would say I am her super fans because her song is very wonderful. I like her so much. She is kind and helpful too. She is a student and always help her friends on homeworks and singing class. When her friends face something hard and she will her with her skills. 

When she come to my home, I will show her some of her posters, CD and sing with her. I will give her a pictures because I know to draw a singer who I like when she go home. If she really come to my home I will be very happy in all of the day. 

Lastly, I would like to thanks to her because her song make me feel haapy and positive.
