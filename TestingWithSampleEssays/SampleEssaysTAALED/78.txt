Nowadays, the plastic bags become more and more useful in people's life. Use the plastic bag to carry the things you just bought from the supermarket is very convenient. But if too many people use plastic bags to carry the things, there will be a lot of waste plastic bags. So I think we should ban the plastic bags in our school.
The first reason is that waste plastic bags is harm to the environment. Because the plastic cannot be recycled, and it is a non degradable waste type. So if we produce and use the plastic bags, they amount of the waste plastic bags cannot be reduced, and if we just dig a hole and put the waste bags in, it will be a very seriou pollution. We cannot recycle the waste plastic bags, so we can olny reuse and reduce the plastic bags. Ban the plastic bags can reduce the amount of the waste bags, and it also can let the students to reuse the bags which they used before. So I think that ban the plastic bags will be a great policy.
Also, buy a new plastic bag for each time is going to waste a lot of money. For example, buy one plastic bag need 5 cents, that isn't too much. But if you buy a plastic bag every day, you will use 150 cents in one month. For a year, you will use 1825 cents. But if you buy a reusable woven bag, you can use it for a long period. So you can save a lot of money. So I think ban the plastic bags can help the students to build a habit what is saving money. That is good for the students working career.
To conclude, I think that to ban the plastic bags will have a lot of advantage.
