My favorite superhero is my dad. My dad looks ordinary from the outside -- short hair, a beard, and wearing a pair of glasses that has a thick black border. Mostly my dad will wear casually with a t-shirt and casual pants. However, not judging from the outside of his, he is in love in lending a hand to people, which I thought of as a special skill. A lot of people like helping others, but this is not the case in regards to my dad. One time, my dad and I went for a stroll on the beach, which is our favorite thing to do during weekends. While we were walking, a group of kids were hanging out on the shore when one of them got stung by a jellyfish and got grabbed away towards the sea. My dad immediately ran towards the child without hesitation with clothes on and pulled him back onto the shore. The child was badly hurt and my dad asked one of the staff for help. From my dad, I know that superheroes don't always wear a cape. Although my dad is ordinary, he has a passion in helping others, whom I admire. I learned that helping others in the community can not only make them feel grateful, but can also make me feel delighted as I just made a person's day. My favorite superhero, my dad.
