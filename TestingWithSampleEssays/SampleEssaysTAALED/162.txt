My favorite superhero is Spider-man, he wears a red superhero suit that covers his whole body from head to toe and it's really tight. It has black stripes that represents the webs, and he wears a black bracelet that shoots out the webs. Spider-man saves people like a spider, he can do really cool tricks such as jumping really high, doing backflips, clinging into walls and he also can sense danger. His webs are really strong and stretchy, he swings everywhere with his webs. He can shoot it out like a rope and a net, and it is also almost impossible to break. Spider-man saves people from the evil humans that wants to destroy the earth, he risks his life just to ensure people are safe and not hurt. I really admire Spider-man because he is very kind-hearted and generous to people, and he is also very brave. He is very young and still has a long way to go but he decides to save people as a hero instead of having a normal teenage life like other teenagers, that's why i really admire him. He has lost a lot of his loved ones but he never gives up, he doesn't only care about the people he knows or love, but he also cares about other people he has never met before.
