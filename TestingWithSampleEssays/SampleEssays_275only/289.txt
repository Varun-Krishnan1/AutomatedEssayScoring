       As we all know,animals are humans friends.Scientists have been studying a variety of wild species for years.In my opinion,kangaroos are the strangest creatures in the world.So the knowledgy about kangaroos will be shown below.
       The kangaroo is a very famous animal in Australia,and it is also one of the symbol animals in Australia,which live in the forests and lands.They like eating grass and fruits.Kangaroos have an enormous size of body,and it is covered with fur.They are always aggressive and strong.However,the most strangest part of the kangaroo is its pouch.Moreover,female kangaroos always hold the baby in a pouch,when the baby kangaroos grow up,they can live independtly and leave the pouch.I still remember the day I first saw a wild kangaroo,I was gripped by the tiny pouch,and when touching,it feels so soft and smooth.
       To sum up,kangaroos are my favourite animal,and they are adorable and strange.
