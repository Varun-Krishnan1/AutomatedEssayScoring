  My favourite season is winter. The weather in winter is amazing, sometimes there will be snow and I could make snowmen, make snow angels and have snowball fights! Summer is really fun too, it is hot and sometimes it might rain. The thing that makes winter my favourite season is because it will snow, and I could go snowboarding with my family. Once I went to Japan when it snowed. I had an awsome holiday, there was gigantic hotels with delicouse food. I slept with my sister and my aunt, my mom and dad had their own room. It was the best trip ever.
