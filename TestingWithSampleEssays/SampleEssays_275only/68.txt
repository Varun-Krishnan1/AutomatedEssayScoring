 Dear Rita,

       Last night, I had a wonderful dream. It was about my old dog Dee Dee was walking again ! Let me tell you about the dream.
       In my dream, I gt up at six o' clock in the morning to cook pancakes. After I made my pan cakes, I feed some of it to Dee Dee, because I didn't llike it. After that, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa, my brother, my uncle and my brother got up at about seven o' clock. So, we ate the delicious, sweet, good smelling pancakes. 
       Then, my mom began to feed Dee Dee's water and food. It smells distgusting ! Suddenly, my dog Dee Dee started barking and walking. Then I woke up. I hope the dream comes true !


Best from, jane
