When a famous person come to my house, I would imagine him to have dark brown skin, thick mustache, short hair with a colour of black, big muscles and about 1.8 meters tall. He is wearing a black suit with shiny shoes and a Stetson Cowboy hat. His career is an architect and because of his hard working with his creativity, he became famous. I will then show him all of my achievements and my LEGO sets, like the Millennium Falcon set or the Grand Piano set. Then I will ask him questions like: Is your job fun?, what is your most famous design?, what is the most fun part of designing a house?, what is the hardest part of designing a house?. Then I will talk about his hobbies and things like that. Then I will ask him to build a house using LEGO and play games with me. First we will play Stardew Valley and then Brawl Star.
