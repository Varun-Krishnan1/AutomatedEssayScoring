    Dear schoolmates, when you are reading this, I would like to invite you to recall the last time you used a plastic bag. When and why did you use it? Have you ever consider the consequences it may bring? If you can't remember, it's fine, but mainwhile, it alarms that using plastic bags has become our daily routine. We have to reverse this situation.
    Plastic, known as the greatest and the worst invention of the twenty-first century, has brought us much harm as convenience. For example, plastic products are hard to break down, every year hundreds and thousands of tons of plastic have flooded into the ocean and the land, causing irreversible pollution and harm to the ecosystem.We have seen distressing pictures online that seagulls are suffocated by plastic bags and sea turtles are wrapped up by plastic bags. What's worse is that some researches have found microplastic inside human body.
    In order to deal with the situation and slow down the spread of plastic, many countries have enacted restrictions on plastic, and we may notice that some supermarkets around us have stopped providing plastic bags. It may cause some inconvenience but it is not insurmountable. I would like to call on everyone that we should ban plastic bags at school in order to do something for the bright future of humanity as teenagers. By wielding our young minds we can change the situation in a small but strong way. We can find repacement for plastic bags, we can persuade others stop using plastic bags, and we can orgnize related zctivities. Join me and ban plastic bags at school would be a good start.
