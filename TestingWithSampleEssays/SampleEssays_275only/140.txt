It is generally believed that some supermarkets have benned plastic bags in recent years. Some students belived that the school should keep using plastic bags. However, in my opinion, plastic bags should be banned in my school. I am going to elaborate my point in the following paragraphs.
First of all, using plastic bags will pollute the envoirment seriously. Nowadays, many people are using the plastic bags, but the plastic are harmful for the ground. It can pollute crops, when people eat food, they might be get poisoned. And using the plastic bags will make people get sick, more serious cases will lead to disease.
Secondly, using plastic bags will cause the death of sea animals. Today, many sea animals die from eating plastic bags. Not only because people throw plastic bags, but also because people produce plastic bags. There is a kind of harmful gas in plastic bags, which can harm people and animal organs. If sea animals die out, it will cause indescribable harm to people and the world. Land animals are no exception too. 
In conclusion, people needs to reduce the using of plastic bags and the production of the plastic bags, and plastic bags should also be banned at school.
