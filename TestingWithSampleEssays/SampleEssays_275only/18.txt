Dear Jeremy,


I once had a dream about me being Cristiano Ronaldo running across the field. 


I was speeding towards the ball when the enemy let out an annoying leg and rolled it away from my sight. I was a bit startled and couldn't react for a split second. When I started to run again towards the football, I realized Bruno Fernandes was closer and already got the ball before I did. My hair on my hands stood up and I was starting to wonder if we would lose this match when I heard the ball hurtle towards the goal. I  but was immediatly caught by the goalkeeper standing in front of it. He rolled the football to one of my enemies but this time I was the one who gave the annoying leg and got it. Then I saw that I was very close to the ball and shot the ball. WHOOSH! The ball flew past the keeper and into the net. The crowd cheered and my teammates took me high in the air and started tossing me around. But then they didn't catch me in time and the secend I knew... THUMP! I landed headed first on the ground and suddenly I opened my eyes and discovered myself lying on my cozy bed in my nice house. I was glad I didn't really fell on the ground head first but also a bit sad as I always wanted to be a famous footballer like Cristiano Ronaldo, and that is my dream. Can you tell me a dream of yours?


Best Regards,

Timothy
