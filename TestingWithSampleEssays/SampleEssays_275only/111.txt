  In the process of growing up there are a range of person who are admirable. in my point of view the suspense mystrey novel writer name is Agatha Cristie is the people who I admire and love most. there is a memorable dream which I dreamed that she came to my hoom and taught me how to write a excellent novel.
  I remember that she knocked at my door and asked : is there anyone in the room, it is raining out side, can I and take shelter from the rain? At first I was curious than as soon as I open the door I was suprised. I quickly let her come in and gave a towel to her. few minetes passed we chetted on the sofa Meawhile I am so suprised that the  'Queen of novel' could come in my house I praised her novel and introduced myself as the same time. than I walked around in my house with her of course I was her fan and there are full of her novel in a bookshelf in addition I showed the novel by me to her, unexpectedly, she taught one by one.
  that is Agatha  my favorite novel writin
