Everyone have favorite seasons.For me, my favorite is summer.In summer,we can do many things,like go to swim, eat ice cream and have summer vacation.But it is too hot.In summer, the weather is very hot,and sometimes it's wet.Why I like it because,first,we can swim,but in winter,the water is very cold, we can go to different swimming pool to play, but in winter,we only swim in class,Then,there is summer vacation,it is longer than winter holiday.So we can go out to play many times.Winter is very cold,we can't go out to play.At last,in summer we can buy many beautiful t-shirts becasue it is thin.This is my answer why my favortie season is summer.
