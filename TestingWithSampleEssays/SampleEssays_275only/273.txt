For my superhero its not like the others not flying around , have other super powers like laser eyes of superman , the speed of the flash or even haveing the power of the universe.
My superhero is always my dad,he doesnt have any superpower any kinds of skills to save people . Many people always asks me "why your dad is your superhero ?" i always answer 
there are not real superheros but the guy who always bring you back from trouble or teaching you how to be ME . It is my dad ,when ever i got in any trouble he wont scold at me like other parents 
he will uses his patience to teach you something that you can uses for lives .
the super power that my dad got is the love he is giving into my heart he works from 9 am to 10pm just to earn much to make  our family happy and do stuff that we want ,the other power is his patience 
whenever i asks questions or have problems in studies or homework he will just sit beside me and talk and teach me until i notice what i was wrong or what i should know.
my dad is my hero there is no other superheros that can change my heart he'll always be my hero my dad my hero.
