My favourite superhero is a star ,her name is  Lisa which it is from Tailand but when she was 14 years old she go to Koera to study.She has a long curly brown hair ,and she always wearing a short skirt ,she looks really pretty that i like her very much. She is good at dancing and singing.Also,she sometimes have a performance in the stage,and there are a lot of fans around her,they clap the hands and cheer up.In addition,when she finish the perforance she will sign up for her fans. She is very kind and usually make the fans happy. Why do i admire her because i think she is hard working.She pratises everyday when we are going to bed that she is pratising her dances.She always take more time to pratise than the other poeple,so this is why i like her .I help she dream can come ture and can more harder in the future.
