In modern times, there are lots of different celebrities who are all famous for a variety of things.

In the unlikely event of a celebrity visiting my home, he/she would likely be famous because of the books he/she writes since I enjoy reading. Reading is like water to me, I need it to survive. My favourite author is J.K Rowling. She has hair the shade of copper which frames her face elegantly, matching with her long and elegant nose. She has stunning and bright blue eyes and thin lips. J.K Rowling is most famous for her book series Harry Potter. I am fascinated with the way she can make an entire world with words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters.

If she ever did visit me, I would make sure to prepare a lot of questions about the process of writing, for example, 'Is writing and publishing a book distressing and tiring in any way?' I would ask these questions because I would like to become a writer someday since in my opinion, spinning a world out of words seems very tempting and also interesting. It would be an exciting way to share my thoughts to people all across the world.

The thing I wouldn't hesitate to show her would be my study room. This is because books are scattered everywhere in my room. My books are my most precious possesions and I usually don't return all of them to the bookshelf since it is already brimming with books. There even is a loose nail in the corner because of the weight of all the books. I sincerely hope that J.K Rowling would approve of my messy book-filled room. I would also show her some of the short descriptions of different places I have written over the years and ask for her commentary and advice.

It would be such a huge wonder if J.K Rowling, or any celebrity, came to visit my home.
