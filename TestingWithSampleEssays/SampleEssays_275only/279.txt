It's a quiet satuday morning when the silence is shattered by the ring of a doorbell. Startled, I rush to the door and hastily open it... And I see a celebrity. She has the same picture-perfect face, glossy hair and slender figure that's been shown in countless beauty magazines, movies, and TV shows. I remember watching her winnning prizes for her acting and being nominated "best actress of the year" through my TV. I awkwardly open the door with an unsure "hello..." that trails off near the end.

Compared to thinking of what I'd ask a famous person, I had a much easier time deciding what I'd show them. Firstly, I'd take the celebrity to my room, which I take quite some pride in. I'd take them to the nook under my bunk bed with the soft yellow lights, beanbags, and shelves of books, show them my collection of cactuses and plants, and doubtlessly, show them my pet cat.
