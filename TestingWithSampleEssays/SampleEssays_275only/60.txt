  Today is the best day in my life. My idol, Alan Walker came in my house for something I don't know. 
  When I heard the bell rang, I vanished to the door. I looked out from the seeker and guess who did I saw? Alan Wlaker, my favorite person in the entire musical space. I was so surprized. I thought: Why would Alan Walker came into my house? When I was expecting all nonsenses  about him, he said :" I'm here for your dad's permission." He said. "Your dad says today is your birthday so I'm here to celebrate with you." I was so happy that I can't even repeat every word he said before. He sang the birthday song to me and blew the candle after I wished. My wish is: I can celebrate my every birthday with my idols in the future.
  Alan Walker leaved, I was still very happy.
  My dad came back with my presents. I gave him a big hug. "Thank you, I love you!" I called out. "I love you too, my sweetheart." He answered.
  Oh! How a wonderful bithday with full of pleasure and piles of presents.
