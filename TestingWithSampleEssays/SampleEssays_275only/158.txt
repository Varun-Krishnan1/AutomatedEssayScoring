  Do you have a favourite superhero? Yes, I have. My favourite superhero is spiderman. He looks very handsome when he doesn't wear his battle suit. However, when he wear on his battle suit, he shows a different feeling which makes me feel that he is a strong and protective person. 
  He has one special skill, which is the reason why this superhero is very popular, the spider silk. With his battle suit, he is able to shot spider silks from his arms to the targets, such as buildings, people, the weapons of the opponents, etc. These spider silks can help him to swing between the buildings, climb on the wall and stop the movements of his opponents. As a result, it is a very useful weapon or skill for spiderman. 
  The reason why I admire spiderman is that he is very helpful and kind. After he knew that he has the ability to shot spider silks, he use this ability to fight against the bad guys and save people in the city, but not use them to harm others. Moreover, heis a perseverance person. Even though he was at a disadvantage in the battle between the bad guys, still, he stand up a fight, but not escape. He shows a lots of good personality in the movies and this is the main reason why I admire him. 
  Spiderman is a really kind and tough person and he is my favourite superhero.
