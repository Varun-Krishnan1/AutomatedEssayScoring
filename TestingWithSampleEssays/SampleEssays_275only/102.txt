Nowadays, there has been an increasing trend of awareness towards outer-space species, which means there has also been an decreasing attention towards animals or living creatures on earth. I will be discusing strangest animal I have seen-kangaroos

To initiate with, the first time I saw kangaroos was on TV. they have the heads that is similar to deers but without horns. The strangest part of their body is 'sleeping bag' that is grown on their stomach part. They also have muscular legs which helps them with their movements. Secondly, most kangaroos habitats' are in  Australia, the 'down under' with strong beam from the sun. Thus the colour of their fur looks light brown. Lastly, in comparison with other animals, kangaroos not only have their 'pocket' on their body, but also have strange techniques of combat, similar to boxing.

As a conclusion, a strange animal are needed to be different, whether it be appearence or the way they fight. From my perspective, kangaroos can verify those factors I just mentioned.
