Bags are convenient  in our daily lives, but some types can cause a lot of harm that we do not mean to. Plastic bags are the most common type of bags made globally, though they do come in cheap prices, they  also cause extereme problems at the same time. In order to produce plastic, an enormous amount of energy and resources is needed; this causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. Although plastic could be recycled, recycling plastic has not been efficient- only about nine percent of plastic ever produces haas been recycles. Marine animals are also victims of plastic, it is harming them and ecosystems of many marine biomes and it's hazardous to human health. Our plastic consumption is directly affecting marine life in the ocean including fish, which is a main source of food for huamns as well.
Additionally, most plastics are single- use. This inclues items like plastic bags, packagings. water bottles and straws. Plastic can take hundreds or even thousands of years to degrade and most don't biodegrade completely. Instead, they gradually break down into tiny pieces of plastic which are significantly harder to remove from the environment than the larger bottles. With all this been said, I highly encourage everyone to thoroughly consider your decisions while choosing shopping bags and to save our environment by canceling out plastic bags from our school campas!
