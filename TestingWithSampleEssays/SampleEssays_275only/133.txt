Good afternoon students, teachers and parents. I am writing this article to you today, to educate you on the harmful effects of plastic bags to the environment in hopes of reducing our usage of plasic bags as a community. The first victims of our excess production of plastic bags are the turtles. Contrary to common beliefs, plastic bags cannot be degraded, hence they often get thrown into landfills near the ocean. This often results in plastic bags (along with other trash), getting scattered into the ocean, leading to turtles unfortunately mistaking it as food. As a consequence, they fall ill/ die as their body is unable to digest it. According to studies, around 1000 turtles fall victim to our excess production and misplacement of these plastic bags.

Furthermore, the production of plastic bags is causing a mass effect on our environment. This is because a large amount toxic pollutants is emitted into the environment in order to produce plastic bags, further accelerating global warming. This effects have already been shown by statistics as scientist speculate that global warming is happening faster than expected due to the climb of demand of plastic. 

In conclusion, I urge you to reduce your usage of plastic bags in school to a minimum and alternatively use reuseable bags. We, as a community, should unite and endevour to save, protect and preserve our marine life. Although some may argue, that our small community would affect little change, given that plastic bags are still the most produced and consumed material in the world, however I believe that if we are able to ban plastic bags here, we would set an amazing precendent for others to follow. Let us be the generation to create change
