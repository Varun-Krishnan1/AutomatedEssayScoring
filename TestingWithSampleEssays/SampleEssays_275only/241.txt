Dear Charmaine,

last night, I had a really interesting dream. First, we were on a ship then we saw a girl jump into the sea so we tried to save her by jumping into the sea.
     After we jumped into the sea, we found ourselves in a village the villagers were very nice. they let us eat lunch with them.B
