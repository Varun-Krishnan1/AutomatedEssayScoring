Dear Bob,

Last night, I had an incredible dream.  I was in a world made up of only food and drinks.  Everything was edible, just like an all-you-can-eat buffet!  There were gingerbread people, candy cane traffic lights, ornage juice rivers, biscuit animals and cars made of hot dogs! 

I saw my family next to me, but to my surprise, they were entirely made of marshmallows.  I began munching ont the trees, which were enormous bunches of broccoli, but instead of brocolli, honey was oozing out.  Suddenly, it was snowing ice-cream everywhere.  I saw a gigantic drumstick and rushed to get a bite, but I woke up to discover that I rolled out of bed.  It was heaven for a child who likes to eat, like me.

I wish that I could visit this world again in the future.  It is the best dream
