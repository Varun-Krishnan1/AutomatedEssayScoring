Plastics have been with us for decades and plays a huge part of our daily life. Believe me when I say you can find plastic just right next to you, for example some parts of your watter bottle is made of plastics or the pen that sits on your table is made of plastic as well. One of the most used plastic of all time is plastic bags.  As time goes by plastic bags has been more acceptable in our daily use and has a positive outlook for our own needs. Yet, not so many people look at the waste of plastic bags and how it has been ruining our enviroment this whole time! Scientist has prooven that plastic can take up to 450 years to be fully removen in our modern world, so in this essay I would like to talk more about this problem that needs to be fully vanished.
As the generation moves on most people became more self absorbed and only caring about their first priorities rather than the people around us. Plastic bags is the cause of living things such as sea creatures decreasing little by little. This is cause by the fact that we are still using plastic bags up till this day and causing more rubbish in to our ocean and our enviroment. Remember that, we all live on earth and absolutely no one wants to live in a nasty enviroment full of trash and plastic bags flowing around everywhere. Killing animals will definitely ruin our food system living us with barely edible food. I am here to tell you all as a member of this school that every of you can make a huge diffirence in the future right now. Starting from today plastic bags should be banned. Rather than using thin, unsustanable bags, why not use cloth bags or reusable bags? This would create a difference for our mother earth and we can always reused it whenever we like! Without your health our earth would not heal and become a happy place for everyone.
