  My favourite superhero is superman. He has big power, strong musles, and he is very tall. He has big eyes and black eyebrows, also short black hair on his head. Superman always wear in blue and red. And of course, he has some specia skills. He can fly, he can see the things that behind other things, he can don't breath air, he has very big power, and most things can't hurt him.  And things I admire him is he is very brave and has big power, so that he can save and protect the people, the city, the country, even the world. He has the skill to protect the things or the people he liked or he wants to protect. Also, he thinks about others a lot, so many people that alived when some bad guys who want to hurt them because of superman. I think superman is very great, he is a good guy, but he just can be a charactor in a bbok.
