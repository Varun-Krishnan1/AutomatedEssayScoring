Hi this is leo , today i'm ganna talk about banned plastic bags .
We often see plastic bags at school , but we have to stop that , plastic bags are bad to the envairoment . If you put a plastic bags in to the ground ,after you grow up you ca still dig it out . but that isn't the biggest proplemt ,i found some of studdent dident put the plastic bag into the garbige bin ,they jst thruo it away .We can find a lots of plastic bags on the ground , wich is very bad action .
And , you can use other bags ,even yaour own bag is greater. The reason that i say that is beacle you can use it agan when you need it .Every one will throu the plastic bags that hase been used befor , so use your own bags ,that is better to envaroment 
Next thing i am going to say is the littel plastic particle.When a plastic bag have been throu away ,the rain will wash some small plastic particle off.
Or it will  flou in to the sea and been eatten by some fish ,there is lots of ways that the plastic particle can get into our body and dammige it.
Use less plastic bags are healthy for the humman,the wild life and for the envaroment.
