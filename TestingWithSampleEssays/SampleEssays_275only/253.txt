I think plastic bags should be banned in our school. First, plastic trash thrown away into the river or sea, they become micro plastics. Most of the sea lifes that eat it will be die. 
Second, many CO2 is made when the plastis trash is burned. CO2 is one of the cause of global warming. For these reasons we have to be banned plastic bags at our school.
