Dear radio station,

I have finished the puzzle that you guys send out last week, and the winner of this competition will win a one-year supply of free chocolate. If I were correct the puzzle was released on the 26 of June. At that time, I was listening to the radio while I'm ready for bed, after I heard about the compitition and the prize, I knew that it's not going to be easy. So, I stayed up that whole night to figured out the puzzle. On the next morning, I send my answer to you guys, but there were no respond. I checked my mail box everyday waiting for a respond from you guys, but nothing happened. Yesterday, when you guys annouced the answer I knew I was corrected, but you guys annouced that there was no winner. Since, no one got it corrected. So, I send this mail to say that I should be the winner of this competition. 

If you guys worried that I am going to keep it for myself, you guys are probable wrong, because I'm going to share it to the people in needs. Eventhough, I am just a farmer on the countryside, and doesn't have much economics to help people overcome their challenges in life. But I also wanted to help them with everything I have, I usually give away pork and vegetables from farm, but I thinks that not eventhough. I want to share the sweetness, and the happiness to everyone around me. Giving them a better life that just only eats pork and vegetable. I hope you guys recieved this mail and understand that should be the winner of this compitition.

Kind regards, 
Peter
