Dear friend, 
I had a dream yesterday about the war fields. In this dream, I had dreamed that my father and mother cheated me to the war fields, I was very scared and until one day a soldier saved me from the battle fields.

After he saved me from the battlefields, he brought me to his little camp in the wild. In the little camp, I had feel the warm once again when I'm at my house. He told me that his job was to defend the enemies from entering the cities,and the enemies' armies are much stronger than ours. So as soon as I and him finished this day, he took me to practice for fighting, shooting, and bombing. In these three, I was excel at shooting, even one enemy walking very fast cannot came out of my eyesight. I did shot him that day. And I get a reward of a jar of sardin fish for shooting the first enemy.

After the first shot of the enemy, I bacame more braver and stronger. Many soldiers had known my "legacy" of killing the first enemy. But the enemy still doesn't know why they lost one of their people.

Once when I'm at the battlefields, I killed many of the enemies, but I got hurt badly. Before I die, I carried the bombs to their main quarters, and boomed the quarters. Many soldiers were very sad about it. So they use all their strengths to destroy the whole enemy force.

Suddenly,I woke up and recognized it was just a dream. But it told me that I need to be ready for fighting the enemies outside anytime!


Truly yours,
Kevin Li
