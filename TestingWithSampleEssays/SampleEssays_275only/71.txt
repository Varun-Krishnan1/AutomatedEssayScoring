Hello everyone,I'm writing to persuade you to stop using plastic bags.
As we all know,plastic bags are really harmful to the environment.They are also called"white pollution".In recent years,some supermarkets have banned plastic bags.In my opinion,we should also stop using them.Plastic bags have been banned in China for over 5 years,which makes the air much better than before.Before this ban came out,I can receive more than 5 plastic bags a day!Some people think giving customers plastic bags for free shows their good service.Luckily,the president made a ban and stop this strange think.
Plastic bags are made from factories and made by plastic.Plastic is a kind of chemistric product,which requires a lot of energy.We are actually short for energy now,so stop using plastic bags will be a good choice to save energy.Instead of using plastic bags,we can use backpacks or cloth bags which can be used fore more than one time.
Should plastic bags be baned in our school?My opinion is,YES.If you agree with me,please stop using them.Saving our planet requires all of your effort.Thank you!
