My favourite anime or superhero character is the all know Uzumaki Naruto. he doesn't have any superheores, but he is a splendid ninja who fought in the fouth ninja war (fake) he has a great spirit of mind and he has a big dream, it was to become the hokage. The hokage was like the president in the ninja world. Everyone first thought he was a monster, becuase his parents have died when he was one, and sealed a monster called Kurama in his body. There are also some people who didn't actually care about the monster in his body, and treated him spectacularly to reach his goal, becoming the hokage. 

However, having a monster in his body made him stronger and more helpful to his comrades. He helped every single friend in the ninja world in the fourth ninja war. He had a positive and clear mind, and he did know what he was doing. When he grew older, not only he helped his own country, but eh also helped other countries and fixing problems. at last, he became the hokage, and finished his dream, with all that hard work, resillience, respect and trust from people.
