    Today, I've got a message that Jay Chou, a very famous pop star is coming to my home.
    When I see him, I am so excited that I can't speak out a word. He's very handsome and fashionable, wearing a pair of sunglasses. He's my idol because of his talent. He can create the songs with both Chinese style and Western style, play the piano and the guitar. He has won The Award of Gold Song for 15 times. Although he's very famous, he's quite modest. He always says that he is always on the way and tries to do it better.
    Taking this opportunity, I would like to ask him a question:" Which is your best work? Which is your favourite song?" Maybe he will say:" The next."
    I will show him my collection of his albums on my shelf. I will also ask him for a signature and take a photo with him. That would be fantastic and memorable.
