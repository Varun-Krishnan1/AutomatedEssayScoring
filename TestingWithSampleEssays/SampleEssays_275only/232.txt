Everywhere in the world, you will see a fangirl like me. They can love us UK or k-pop, or an actress. But the most popular of them is K-pop. And I love it too, I'm a big fan of BTS.

I start to be a fandom of BTS when I listen to their music in my mom's car. I often listen to music when I arrived at my English class. I really love that song and then I start to search for BTS. BTS is the boy group very famous, when they debut they just a kpop group that no one knows as. But after many years, they tried hard, and then now on if you say about BTS almost everybody will know about them, They have been hard-working every day and practiced very much. There music was full of the beautiful meaning in every mv, and I think that the reason that every fan  always be loyal with them. 
If one day, they come to my house I will gonna insane and scream really loud, I will describe myself, then cook Vietnam traditional food for them. And then talking about anything, how much I love them, the ways that I become their fan or about what I was doing when I am your fan and how the other people who are their fan insure about them. I think it will be really funny if I show them the picture when their fans cosplay like them or their meme that made by fans. I really want to show them my room, it is decorated with all their poster and their album. Most of the posters that I take from the fan's event. My room was really boring before but after decorating with those posters is been really amazing. I feel better when looking at that picture of them after a long day at school. I will show how pretty the view is from the window, I think they will really love it
I know that your idol or a famous person coming to your home is unbelieve, and me too but if just meet them for a second I want to say that I really love them.
