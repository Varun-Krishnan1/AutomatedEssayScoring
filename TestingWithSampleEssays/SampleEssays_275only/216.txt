my favorite superhero is a spiderman because when i was a child i always watch spiderman  movie . its inspiring me to become spiderman in real life but its just a film and didnt exits . The spiderman look like an spider that have a big strenght with he's own skill to jump with spider rope from other top of the building to another top. One of the reason i love my superhero spiderman because of helped many people who got problem that afected seriously happened on their life, and also i really apreciate  the spiderman  character in daily life because without any problem that happen the spiderman used he's daily activities like normaly people that goes to school and helped he's family like usually. My superhero spiderman is a mistery from their town because no one knew that the real spiderman who always helped many people in there are from a normal people that did activities like they and he's own family as well.
