I am sure most of you realize that our earth is slowly dying. One of the main reason this is happening is because of pollution. Due to pollution, we can see the changes that are happening around us such as, the changes in the temperature, weather, and environment. There are two main types of pollution; air pollution and water pollution. Today, I'm disccusing mostly about the water pollution and how we can help our earth get better. Water pollution starts from the trash we produce everyday, more specifically, plastic trash. The plastics such as: cups, spoons, straws, and bags that we use everyday are dangerous for our environment/earth. If these plastics are not discarded in the right way, they can end up in the ocean which will harm the sea life. From there the cycle begins, most of the earth's body of water is going to start to get polluted and if it happened as said before our sea life will get harmed especially our coral reefs which is not going to be good for everyone. We can start preventing this by reducing the use of plastics like instead of using plastic bags, we can use reusable bags instead. Even though this is a small start it will definetely help our earth to get better and safe for us all.
