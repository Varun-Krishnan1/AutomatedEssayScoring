Hello fellow students and teachers, around the world, we have experienced many different changes with our world including the vast technology advancement through cars, phones and even different travel methods from areas that we never thought will be possible a hundred years ago. However, the many benefits that came from the advancement of human society has also had its drawbacks, climate change, decline in mental health, and the use of harmful objects that indirectly affect the planet such as plastic. In this article, I would be explaining why we should be banning plastic bags in our prosperous school.

First and foremost, plastic bags are extremely difficult to decompose safely. Most things around the world decompose and give back the energy to the soil beneath our feet, plastic bags on the other hand dont decompose after many unreal circumstances, like being eaten, being left to rot and even being burnt up into flames. All three methods of decomposition is detrimental to the environment. Letting the plastic being eaten by other animals would most likely strangle the animal or make it stay inside the animal killing them slowly, if it were to be captured by food hawlers, the animal that ate it would be served to some of us which would indirectly mean that we are eating plastic. Leaving it to rot on the other hand would take years to decompose and would likely damage all of the surrounding environment and all of this would be for a one time use of convienience. After the first two options, burning plastic would seem to be the most optimum way to get rid of plastic. However this might be the most dangerous way to get rid of plastic. Not only plastic is extremely durable, many plastic particles is light enough to blend into the air around us which would mean that we would be breathing plastic. 

Secondly, plastic waste has been used all around the world and millions of tonnes of plastic is sent to the landfill every year. According to a variety of different sources, it is stated that there have been over 400 million tonnes of plastic waste each year around the globe. As a school, we could be contributing to the cause by the many tonnes of plastic waste that we produce every day like packing food, using them as bottles and much more. We as a school could produce over 1000 tonnes of plastic waste alone per year. This number should not be allowed to rise any further as this issue could be stopped if we were to ban the entire school from using plastic. 

In conclusion, if the entire school were to completely stop the use of plastics in general, we could contribute to slowing down the crisis of climate change and help protect the environment better. With our the luxury of learning about this topic, lets all rise against plastic usage and protect the earth from climate change together.
