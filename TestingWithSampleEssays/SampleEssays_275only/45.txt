In recent years, some supermarkets have banned plastic bags, and I believe that it is a good thing. Nowadays people rarely reuse or recycle plastic bags, since they aren't easy to reuse but are very cheap. However, each time a plastic bag is thrown away, they will mostly be discarded, sometimes in the ocean or burnt. Yet these actions are bad for our environment, in the ocean, there are tons of trash, killing wildlife and disturbing entire food chains. Burning them releases lots of CO2 which is a greenhouse gas, and will contribute to global warming, causing disaster in nature, melting the polar ice caps and causing rises in sea level. All of this is because of people throwing away plastic bags, and also because of cars, factories and even cows. If we do not use plastic bags, then a lot of this can be avoided. If you think that what you do or not do matters not, then you are wrong, as every little bit helps, and with enough people, it will make some difference. Therefore, I believe that we should ban plastic bags at our school, so that we can contribute to the fight against pollution, and help make the world we live on a better place.
