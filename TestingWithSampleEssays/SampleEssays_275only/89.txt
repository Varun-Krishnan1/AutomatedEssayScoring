Iron Man is my favourite superhero for many reasons. Tony Stark is a man with dark hair and a beard, but people know him for his gold and red suit of armor. Even though Tony Stark doesn't have any super powers, he is really intelligent and is the owner of Stark Industries a multi-billion dollar company. With his advantage in technology, he was able to design a suit that can be used to defend citizens from evil forces. I admire how Tony Stark works really hard to design new technology that is beneficial towards mankind and how he goes out of his way to help others.
