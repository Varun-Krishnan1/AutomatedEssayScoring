Ban Plastic Bags!

Using plastic bags when grocery shopping or buying food is very convient as you don't have to bring your own reusable market bag. However have you ever thought about how harmful plastic bags can be to the environment? In this article, I will be sharing my opinions on why banning plastic bags in our school is important.

Plastic, in general can take up to 1000 years to decompose. It is very harmful to the environment because even after it decompose, there would still be a lot of toxic particles from it. If animals accidently ingest them, they might die or have long-term health issues. This might potentially harm the ecosystem too. 

Moreover, if plastic bags are disposed incorrectly and are thrown into the ocean, it can harm the aquatic life. Studies in the US shows that every year, about 300 billion plastic bags are ended in the ocean. Imagine how how your living environment would be like if your home is invaded by tons of plastic bags. Horrible!

Lastly, recycling plastic bags are extremely difficult. The reason for that is because plastics are made up of serveral types of polymers, and meltng them together makes it so difficult and close to impossible to recycle. 

I understand that we can sometimes be forgetful, so to make it easier for everyone, our school should consider using paper bags intead. Paper bags are much more environmental friendly and it is as convinient as using a plastic bag. 

I hope that you understand the importance of banning plastic bags in our school. One small step can change the entire world.
