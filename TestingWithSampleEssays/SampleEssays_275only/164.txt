 I think plastic bags should be banned at your school,and I have three reasons to you.Every year over100,000 Marine animals died,because they being entangled in or ingesting plastic bags.Because maybe a piece of junk,it would lead to extinction of Marine life.The plastic bags thrown into the ocean take 200 to 1000 years to degrade.

The second reason is that plastic bags may cause our school very dirty.The plastic bags are very cheap.When students buy something in the supermarket,they can pay more one yuan and get a plastic bag.So they aiways don't care their plastic bags.They may let the plastic bags fiutter around our beautiful school.

Sometimes the plastic bag can cause serious danger even among low grade students.students may play with the plastic bags.
