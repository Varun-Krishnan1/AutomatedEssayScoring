One special night, i went to bed. I went into  a very, very deep sleep. I suddenly had the most wonderful dream ever! I could fly over the city and flew to space with a magical cat and flew on the planet known as makemake (a dwarf planet) and I had a space party i did not need to breath air and i also could fly! I flew around the planet with magical cat who could also fly, and also survive without air! the magical cat and me flew to ttrhe middle of the planet there was a giant carnival with games and roller coasters, and the best of all the worlds biggest and bounciest trampoline! The cat and me played everything in the carnival including the trampoline. But then suddenly a gigantic chicken wearing a giant belt and said " I am here to find corn, I want corn and just corn only. If there is no corn, I shall find some corn myself." "There is corn on earth and something called popcorn! I don't know how to explain it, but just go to earth and find some corn please." So finally the giant chicken just floated away while doing a T pose. It was hilarious! Then chili dogs rained from the sky, and it was so delicous, but then a demon grabbed me and the cat and dropped me in a hamburger trap the cat said " you can beat the hamburgers!" So I grabbed the cat and flew out of the trap and beat the demon, then I woke up. This was the best dream ever!
