Today is Saturday, when it was still seven in the morning, I heard the doorbell rang. Mum opened the door and two men with black suit and glasses came apart. They said,"Hi, madame. You won a draw from our company, Hamburgini. And so, you will meet the founder in this afternoon. He will come to you house by around 1 to 2 o'clock. Then, the two men walked away.

Mum was very excited and delighted. She quickly told me to get up and tidy up the whole house. After a very tired morning tiding up, the doorbell rang. A men wearing a white suit and a gold bow-tie came into sight. Mum and I warmly welcomed him and gave him some lemon tea. The men smiled and said,"Nice to meet you two, I'm called Lukas. I'm the founder of the famous car developer Hamburgini. You participated in our company's carnival draw last week, and you won the top prize, a Hamburgini's newest car!" Mum was extremely on the moon after hearing this news. After that, we had a afternoon tea with waffles and ice lollies. Then, I showed him my Lego blocks and my beautiful bedroom. He enjoyed and said,"I like playing lego when I'm young, I like playing it with my son too. After a while, it's time for Lukas to go back home, we are very happy to have a day like this.

At dinner, Mum cooked my favourite curry and sushi to celebrate she got a car. I was very delighted too! I hope Mum can win more prizes so I can eat my favourite food again!
