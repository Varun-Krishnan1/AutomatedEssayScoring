It is important to keep our Earth clean and beautiful,The earth is becoming more and more dirtier now,beacause human need to develop.But along with industrialization,it also destroyed the earth's environment.This also includes plastic bag pollution.So I think plastic bags should be banned at our school.There are some reasons of my opinion.
First,plastic bags will pollute the environment,plastic bags are hard to disapper on their own so that human need to burn millions of plastic bags which people have used before every year.This will make the air beacome not clean as before.If people always breathe dirty air,their body may beacome bad.Can you imagine your famliy or your friends body become very bad?This is why some supermarkets in a number og countries have banned plastic bags in recent years.
What's more,we don't need to buy something always with a plastic bag.Now,more and more countries have ddeveped many new types of bags instead of Plastuc bags.The new types of bags won't make pollution to our mother land.We always use plastic bag to carry something,but after that we just throw it to the ban,it is such a waste for students,even for people.So why not to use a new type of bag to shopping instead of plastic bags which will destory our environment and bad for our health.
Finally,let's protect our earth and the environment together.Plastic bags should be banned at our school,isn't it?
