When a famous foreign hip hop singer comes to my house.I'll be shocked and probably cry.I hope he is Drake.He may wair a pair of sunglasses,a hat,is likely to take 24 K golden ring and necklace with shining dimond.Because of his songs,he became a hit all over the world in 2019.He is a rapper,and there is a recording studio too.So I'd liked to listen  him singing.I'll show him around my room,I have a lot his records and albums.Then I'll probably sing with him.I will say'Thank you for coming to my house!"And ask for his signature.What a nice imaginenation.But I think I should be realistic.I don't quite believe that a famous person will come to my house.If it happens,I'll not believe what I see and i hope that will come soon!
