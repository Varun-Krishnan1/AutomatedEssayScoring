I love winter and it's my favorite. I like summer too but not too much. The summer weather is very hot and it could fry an egg. But we can go on holiday, go shopping or go to the beach. The weather in winter in the morning is quite cold but at the night we have to wear very thick shirts. Winter is my favorite season because I love cold weather. We can eat hot food or even go on a trip with our family. Sometimes, during the snowfall, we can build a snowman, throw snowballs at each other, and have a lot of fun games we can make.
