Dear students,
  It might have come to your attention, that in recent years, supermarkets reduced the use of plastic bags. Plastic bags are successful and beneficial intentions, they are convenient and easy to produce. As a result, it is confusing to see plastic bags getting banned. However, I totally agree with the 'supermarket policy'.
  To commence with, plastic bags are damaging to the environment. The reason is that plastic bags are made of plastics, making them hard to dissolve. Once you throw it away,  the only way to deal with it is to bury it in the soil. As a consequence, the plastic bag remains there for decades, then ends up with harmful chemicals. The plants there are not able to grow, and the herbs do not have food to eat. A little plastic bag can cause an unchangeable disaster to the environment.
  Further, as you can see on TikTok, YouTube, and in newspapers. Lots of animals died because they mistakenly ate plastic items or were unable to breathe because of a plastic bag stuck in their mouths. pitiful and unbearable news comes one by one. If you still pay little attention to the horrible results that humans made by just a small mistake. The earth will be surrounded by plastic bags. And the next who would be killed by plastic bags might be human lives.
  From all the above, this is what I strongly support for the ban on plastic bags. Not only I should do it, but also my dearest classmates that I have seen and greeted on every beautiful morning thanks to the gorgeous environment. I implore you, to stop using plastic bags instead of reusable bags. It takes step by step to bring back the lovely home for the species killed by light and small plastic bags. It starts with you and me. Please stop using plastic bags at school and elsewhere. By doing so, we are contributing to a better world.
