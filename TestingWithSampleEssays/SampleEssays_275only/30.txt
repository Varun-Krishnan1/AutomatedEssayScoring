Dear school

Pollution and global warming are some of the most really serious issues in the world right now, what causes it, is plastics. But that's is not the main reason pollution happens, unresponsible people who threw that plastic product out the nature, they threw it into the ocean, the streets, and basically everywhere they go. You might think pollution and global warming are nothing, and that will happen years later, but if we keep on doing this, especially the adults, then their children and kids will look up to them, repeat what their parents did and that will speed up the process causing those issues to happen sooner. I love my school, our school, I always wanted the best for us, wanted us to be the best. So I think, we should really ban plastic bags, I don't think this is a big deal, because we can replace them with something else, like a canvas bag for example, but don't worry, plastic products surrounding our classroom shouldn't be a ban, those are plastics that we can reuse and won't release them out to the environment. But plastic products in our cafeteria should be a ban, because those are items we won't reuse, like a plastic water bottle, have you ever wondered how long it takes for a plastic water bottle to fully decompose? 450 years, for a 500ml plastic water bottle, that's insane, don't you think? A few supermarkets in some countries have banned plastic bags, even some schools have also done it, so why can't we achieve that goal too? I really wish you take my message seriously, this is just my opinion, I really want the best for our school so that's why I wrote and sent you guys this message because usually, I won't be writing letters to the school community if a problem is not that serious. Thank you for taking time out and reading my words.
