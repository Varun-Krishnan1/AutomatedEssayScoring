Happy. A feeling that a lot of teenagers might think has abandoned them and are longing to have the same feeling of going to the beach for the first time. You might think that you've grown too old for happiness to flow into your life. But don't worry, here you can find advices to regain the happiness that you thought you've lost from a teenager who is enjoying his life and is happy about his current situation.
Firstly. Enjoy everything at it's fullest and get the most out of everything. When you're doing the things that you love, rather it's going out with friends. You might often come across times when you think happy times are often short and they aren't worth having as they're so short. Everything has an end, and it happens with both happy and sad times. Remeber, it's rather you've enjoyed it or learned anything from it. So when you notice that you're having the short and happy times, remember to enjoy every second of it and treasure every moment of it. Be happy it happened, don't be sad it ended.
Secondly. Don't overthink about the accidents or mistakes you've caused or made. I myself have came across mistakes or accidents that I didn't want to happen. Back then I would cry myself to bed after a little mistake I made and overthink about it for days. One day I was tired of this and I wanted to feel happier and worry less. So on that day onwards, I told myself that i have to learn from my mistakes and try to prevent that from happening ever again. Mistakes were meant to make and as long as you don't redo the same mistake and are really sorry for your actions, it's alright. Everything is worth learning from and most importantly, learn from your mistakes try your best to prevent it.
That's it fro
