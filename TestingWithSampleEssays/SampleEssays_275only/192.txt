Mobile phones. An invention that has improved billions of people's life quality by making communication way easier than what we had 4 decades ago. But with such advantage comes a lot of disadvanteges such as spending less time outside.etc. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages that comes with such easy communication.
Firstly, mobile phones can improve relationships with our family, reletives and friends. Back before mobile phones were a thing, family members are seperated during working hours and weren't able to chat with each others and they had to wait untill they're home to be even able to greet. But now, we can talk to each other with just a fews of a button. We can know more about our own family and understand the work environment of each other. Which can make the already strong bond in the family even stronger with ease. 
Secondly, parents won't have to worry too much as their kids have phones, they can call their parents in an emergency or call for help if they are in danger. Friends will also fell better to know that they can communicate with their friends easily. Friends can also plan a meetup online instead of having the need to meet up in person just to plan when to eat lunch together.
But with all the advantages and happiness. There also has a disadvantage to having the ability to communicate easily. For a lot of teenagers, they might lose the will to meet their friends in person since they can call their friends or chat with them in messaging apps without even leaving their bed. This will for sure ruin their mental health and physical health for not going outside. Which will cause teens to feel as if they are useless in the outside world as the world functions normally without them even stepping outside of their room. This will make them feel depressed and sad, as they start to make themselves only look at the bad side of things and not try to find a way out as they can always escape the real world through the online world.
But in my opinion. As long as we use our mobile phone in the right way and that we can impact ourselves or others for the better, it's a wonderful invention.
