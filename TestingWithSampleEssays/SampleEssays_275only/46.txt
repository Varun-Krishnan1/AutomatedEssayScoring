The summer weather is hot and humid. You often sweat and feel hot. In that weather, no matter when, the air conditioner is always switched on. People often go swimming or to the beach, where the breeze is cool. Also, you will want to stay at home aand enjoy the fan or air con.

Winter is cool and dry. Many people think that it is a good weather for running, or hiking because you won't feel to hot and sweat that much. In some places, there will be snow, and, one more activity will be added----playing in the snow. You can play with snow balls or build snowmans, and some people like lying in the snow, making a snow angel. You can go skiing as well, which is almost hiking but just going down.

I like winter best. It is because I don't like to waste electricity and switch on the air con that much. When I sometimes feel heated, I would just switch on the fan or just go on with the heat. If there was snow in HK, then of course I would want to go and play in the snow. My favourite activity in the snow is skiing and making a snowman, which I like doing with my brother. He is very good at building snowmans. Especially big ones. We would make the snowman as large as we can. My brother doesn't ski, he only snowboards. We like doing those side by side. So we can chat while we slide down the hill. Winter is very fun. When I go skiing, it always brings me back to the times when I was small, and also before my brother went to England. Luckily, he will come back soon and I am looking forward to doing those things in the snow again.

Summer is boring, only hot and humid, you can feel. You can't do much in Summer
