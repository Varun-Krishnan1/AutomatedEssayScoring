The famous person that will come to my house is Newton. He was a famous mathmatician that knew that Earth has gravity.If he is coming to my house, I will show him all my technology to him and that includes my computers and my iPads. He probably had not see this before. Then, I will tell him about my televisions and how they work. I will also tell him about Chinese caligraphy. It was just writing beautiful characters with a kind of "brush pen". Maybe he wanted to try it.

I'm not only telling him my technologies, I'm also telling him about astronomy. For example, Pluto was a planet that was the farthest of all the 8 planets, which included Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Next, I will tell him about heliocentrism. It is about the Sun in the centre in the Solar System. And a astronomer called Galileo prevented evidence for it.

What a nice talk with Newton! I hope I can see him again in the future!
